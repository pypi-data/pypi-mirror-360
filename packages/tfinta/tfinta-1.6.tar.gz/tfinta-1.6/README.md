## Overview

TFINTA (Transport for Ireland Data) is a small, batteries-included toolkit for working with publicly-available Irish public-transport datasets—right from your shell or from pure Python.

| What you get | CLI entry-point | What it does |
|:-------------|:---------------:|:-------------|
| Static GTFS schedules for bus, rail, ferry, Luas… | `gtfs` | Download the national GTFS bundle, cache it, and let you inspect any table (agency, stops, routes, shapes, trips, calendars…). |
| Irish Rail / DART schedules (their separate GTFS feed) | `dart` | Same idea, but focused on heavy-rail only—extra helpers for station boards and service calendars. |
| Live train movements via the Irish Rail XML feed | `realtime` | Query the current running trains or a live arrivals/departures board for any station. |
| Python API | `import tfinta` | Load the cached databases as Pandas DataFrames or iterate over strongly-typed dataclasses. |

The authors and the library/tools art ***NOT*** affiliated with TFI or Irish Rail. The project simply republishes data that both agencies already expose for free. Always check the license/terms on the upstream feeds before redistributing.

Why another transport library?

* One-stop shop – static schedules and live positions under a single import.
* Zero boilerplate – no need to remember URLs; the code bundles them.
* Typed, 90%+ test-covered, MIT-compatible – ideal for research, hobby dashboards or production back-ends.
* Friendly CLI – perfect for quick shell exploration or cron-driven exports.

Happy hacking & *fáilte chuig sonraí iompair na hÉireann!*

## Use

The TFINTA CLI (`gtfs`, `dart` and `realtime` commands) lets you download, cache, inspect, and pretty-print the official Transport for Ireland Rail and DART schedule dataset from your shell. It also allows you access to realtime data provided by the rail service.

### Install

To use in your project/terminal just do:

```sh
poetry add tfinta  # (or pip install tfinta)
```

(In code you will use as `from tfinta import dart` for example.)

### Quick start

```shell
poetry add tfinta             # 1: Install the library
poetry run gtfs read          # 2: Download latest GTFS feed (cached for 7 days)
poetry run gtfs print basics  # 3: View some basics (files, agencies, routes)
poetry run dart print stops   # 4: Show all DART stops
poetry run dart print trips -d 20250701  # 5: Show all DART trips for 1st Jul 2025
poetry run realtime print running        # 6: See the trains currently running on the network
```

### GTFS tool: `gtfs`

All commands are executed through Poetry so your project’s virtual-env is used: `poetry run gtfs [-v] <command> [<sub-command>] [options]`

* `-v` / `-vv` / `-vvv` / `-vvvv` Raise log level from `ERROR` → `WARN` → `INFO` → `DEBUG**`
* `<command>` Either read (download/update data) or print (pretty-print parts of the DB)
* `<sub-command>` Only required for `print` (see below)
* options Command-specific flags (see full `-h` output below)

Below is the exact `-h`/`--help` output so you can see every flag at a glance. Each block is produced with the same Poetry invocation you will use (`poetry run gtfs …`).

```text
usage: gtfs [-h] [-v] {read,print} ...

positional arguments:
  {read,print}
    read         Read DB from official sources
    print        Print DB

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Increase verbosity (use -v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv for ERR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG output)
```

#### `gtfs read` command

Downloads / refreshes the GTFS zip, parses it and stores it locally. The data will live, by default, in `src/tfinta/.tfinta-data/transit.db`, the caching will share the `src/tfinta/.tfinta-data` directory.

```text
usage: gtfs read [-h] [-f FRESHNESS] [-u UNKNOWNFILE] [-i UNKNOWNFIELD] [-r REPLACE] [-o OVERRIDE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FRESHNESS, --freshness FRESHNESS
                        Number of days to cache; 0 == always load (default: 10)
  -u UNKNOWNFILE, --unknownfile UNKNOWNFILE
                        0 == disallows unknown files ; 1 == allows unknown files (default: 1)
  -i UNKNOWNFIELD, --unknownfield UNKNOWNFIELD
                        0 == disallows unknown fields ; 1 == allows unknown fields (default: 0)
  -r REPLACE, --replace REPLACE
                        0 == does not load the same version again ; 1 == forces replace version (default: 0)
  -o OVERRIDE, --override OVERRIDE
                        If given, this ZIP file path will override the download (default: empty)
```

Examples:

```shell
# Force-download the feed even if cached < 7 days
poetry run gtfs read -f 0

# Parse a local experimental feed instead of the official zip
poetry run gtfs read -o /tmp/gtfs-test.zip

# Replace an existing version even if it has the same feed_info.txt version
poetry run gtfs read -s 1
```

#### `gtfs print` command

Pretty-prints pieces of the cached database. Requires one sub-command that selects what to show.

```text
usage: gtfs print [-h] {basics,calendars,stops,shape,trip,all} ...

positional arguments:
  {basics,calendars,stops,shape,trip,all}
    basics              Print Basic Data
    calendars           Print Calendars/Services
    stops               Print Stops
    shape               Print Shape
    trip                Print Trip
    all                 Print All Data

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

Sub-commands & examples:

| Sub-command | What it shows | Options | Example |
|:------------|:--------------|:--------|:--------|
| `basics` | Feed metadata (agency, version, date span, language…) |  | `poetry run gtfs print basics` |

| `trip` | Stop-times, shape and calendar for one trip | `-i ID, --id ID` Trip ID` | `poetry run gtfs print trip -i 4452_210` |
| `all` | A concatenation of every printable section |  | `poetry run gtfs print all > everything.txt` |

### DART tool: `dart`

All commands are executed through Poetry so your project’s virtual-env is used: `poetry run dart [-v] <command> [<sub-command>] [options]` (same `-v` flag and command/sub-command structure as with `gtfs`).

```text
usage: dart [-h] [-v] {read,print} ...

positional arguments:
  {read,print}
    read         Read DB from official sources
    print        Print DB

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Increase verbosity (use -v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv for ERR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG output)
```

### `dart read` command

Downloads or refreshes the Rail-&-DART GTFS zip, parses it and stores it locally. Basically a wrapper for `gtfs read`.

```text
usage: dart read [-h] [-f FRESHNESS] [-r REPLACE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FRESHNESS, --freshness FRESHNESS
                        Number of days to cache; 0 == always load (default: 10)
  -r REPLACE, --replace REPLACE
                        0 == does not load the same version again ; 1 == forces replace version (default: 0)
```

### `dart print` command

Pretty-prints slices of the cached DART database. Requires one sub-command selecting what to display.

```text
usage: dart print [-h] {calendars,stops,trips,station,trip,all} ...

| `all` | Concatenation of every printable section |  | `poetry run dart print all > dart.txt` |

### Realtime tool: `realtime`

All commands are executed through Poetry so your project’s virtual-env is used: `poetry run dart [-v] <command> [<sub-command>] [options]` (same `-v` flag and command/sub-command structure as with `gtfs`).

```text

## Data Sources

### Stations

[GPT Search](https://chatgpt.com/share/683abe5a-9e80-800d-b703-f5080a69c970)

[Official dataset Rail&DART](https://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/)

1. [Get All Stations](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/realtime.asmx/getAllStationsXML) - usage  returns a list of all stations with `StationDesc`, `StationCode`, `StationId`, `StationAlias`, `StationLatitude` and `StationLongitude` ordered by Latitude, Longitude. Example:

```xml
<objStation>
    <StationDesc>Howth Junction</StationDesc>
    <StationAlias>Donaghmede ( Howth Junction )</StationAlias>
    <StationLatitude>53.3909</StationLatitude>
    <StationLongitude>-6.15672</StationLongitude>
    <StationCode>HWTHJ</StationCode>
    <StationId>105</StationId>
</objStation>
```

### Trains

[Official running Trains](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/)

1. [Get All Running Trains](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/realtime.asmx/getCurrentTrainsXML) - Usage returns a listing of 'running trains' ie trains that are between origin and destination or are due to start within 10 minutes of the query time. Returns `TrainStatus`, `TrainLatitude`, `TrainLongitude`, `TrainCode`, `TrainDate`, `PublicMessage` and `Direction`.

* a . `TrainStatus` = ***N*** for not yet running or ***R*** for running.

* b . `TrainCode` is Irish Rail's unique code for an individual train service on a date.

* c . `Direction` is either *Northbound* or *Southbound* for trains between Dundalk and Rosslare and between Sligo and Dublin.  for all other trains the direction is to the destination *eg. To Limerick*.

* d . `Public Message` is the latest information on the train uses ***\n*** for a line break *eg AA509\n11:00 - Waterford to Dublin Heuston (0 mins late)\nDeparted Waterford next stop Thomastown*.

```xml
<objTrainPositions>
    <TrainStatus>N</TrainStatus>
    <TrainLatitude>51.9018</TrainLatitude>
    <TrainLongitude>-8.4582</TrainLongitude>
    <TrainCode>D501</TrainCode>
    <TrainDate>01 Jun 2025</TrainDate>
    <PublicMessage>D501\nCork to Cobh\nExpected Departure 08:00</PublicMessage>
    <Direction>To Cobh</Direction>
</objTrainPositions>
```

### GTFS Schedule Files

The [Official GTFS Schedules](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/operator-gtfs-schedule-files) will have a small 19kb CSV, [currently here](https://www.transportforireland.ie/transitData/Data/GTFS%20Operator%20Files.csv), that has the positions of all GTFS files. We will load this CSV to search for the `Iarnród Éireann / Irish Rail` entry.

GTFS is [defined here](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/). It has 6 mandatory tables (files) and a number of optional ones. We will start by making a cached loader for this data into memory dicts that will be pickled to disk.

## Development Instructions

### Setup

If you want to develop for this project, first install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/), but make sure it is like this:

```sh
brew uninstall poetry
python3.11 -m pip install --user pipx
python3.11 -m pipx ensurepath
# re-open terminal
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export@^1.8  # allows export to requirements.txt (see below)
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true  # creates venv inside project directory
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <TOKEN>      # add you personal project token
```

Now install the project:

```sh
brew install python@3.11 python@3.13 git
brew update
brew upgrade
brew cleanup -s
# or on Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3.11 python3.11-venv git

git clone https://github.com/BellaKeri/TFINTA.git TFINTA
cd TFINTA

poetry env use python3.11  # creates the venv: use 3.11, but supports 3.13
poetry install --sync      # HONOR the project's poetry.lock file, uninstalls stray packages
poetry env info            # no-op: just to check

poetry run pytest
# or any command as:
poetry run <any-command>
```

To activate like a regular environment do:

```sh
poetry env activate
# will print activation command which you next execute, or you can do:
source .env/bin/activate                         # if .env is local to the project
source "$(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate"  # for other paths

pytest

deactivate
```

### Updating Dependencies

To update `poetry.lock` file to more current versions:

```sh
poetry update  # ignores current lock, updates, rewrites `poetry.lock` file
poetry run pytest
```

To add a new dependency you should:

```sh
poetry add "pkg>=1.2.3"  # regenerates lock, updates env
# also: "pkg@^1.2.3" = latest 1.* ; "pkg@~1.2.3" = latest 1.2.* ; "pkg@1.2.3" exact
poetry export --format requirements.txt --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

If you added a dependency to `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
poetry run pip3 freeze --all  # lists all dependencies pip knows about
poetry lock     # re-lock your dependencies, so `poetry.lock` is regenerated
poetry install  # sync your virtualenv to match the new lock file
poetry export --format requirements.txt --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

### Creating a New Version

```sh
# bump the version!
poetry version minor  # updates 1.6 to 1.7, for example
# or:
poetry version patch  # updates 1.6 to 1.6.1
# or:
poetry version <version-number>
# (also updates `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`)

# publish to GIT, including a TAG
git commit -a -m "release version 1.7"
git tag 1.7
git push
git push --tags

# prepare package for PyPI
poetry build
poetry publish
```

### TODO

* Versioning of GTFS data
* Migrate to SQL?
