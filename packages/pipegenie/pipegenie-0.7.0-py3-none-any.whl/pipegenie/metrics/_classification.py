"""
Metrics to assess performance of classification models given predicted classes or probabilities.

Functions named as ``*_score`` return a scalar value to maximize:
the higher the better.

Functions named as ``*_error`` or ``*_loss`` return a scalar value to minimize:
the lower the better.

    Accuracy classification score.

    In multilabel classification, this function computes subset accuracy: the set of labels
    predicted for a sample must exactly match the corresponding set of labels in y_true.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Ground truth (correct) labels.

    y_pred : 1d array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.

    Returns
    -------
    accuracy : float
        The fraction of correctly classified samples.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> y_true = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> y_pred = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Compute the balanced accuracy.

    The balanced accuracy in binary and multiclass classification problems to deal with
    imbalanced datasets. It is defined as the average of recall obtained on each class.
