Sphinx Documentation
--------------------
This directory contains the user manual for the python-control
toolbox.  The documentation is built using sphinx.  The master toctree
document is index.rst.

Note: Sphinx actually runs and imports python code, so broken code, or
code not in conf.py sys.path, cannot be documented!

1.  Get Sphinx [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/]
    [python setup.py build/install]

2.  Install numpydoc [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc]

3.  In Makefile point to your own copy of sphinx-build, e.g.
    [SPHINXBUILD   = /Users/steve/CODES/Sphinx-1.0.6/sphinx-build.py]

4.  >> touch *.rst
    >> make html  [or make latex]

Creating/updating the manual on readthedocs.org:

5.  Log in to readthedocs.org and go to the 'Admin' menu for
python-control.  Choose 'Versions' from the sidebar and mark the
latest release as 'Active'.  Update the default version if needed.
