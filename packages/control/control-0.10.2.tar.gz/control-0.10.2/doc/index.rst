Python Control Systems Library
##############################

The Python Control Systems Library (python-control) is a Python
package that implements basic operations for analysis and design of
feedback control systems.

.. rubric:: Features

- Linear input/output systems in state space and frequency domain
- Nonlinear input/output system modeling, simulation, and analysis
- Block diagram algebra: serial, parallel, and feedback interconnections
- Time response: initial, step, impulse, and forced response
- Frequency response: Bode, Nyquist, and Nichols plots
- Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability
  margins, phase plane plots, root locus plots
- Control design: eigenvalue placement, LQR, H2, Hinf, and MPC/RHC
- Trajectory generation: optimal control and differential flatness
- Model reduction: balanced realizations and Hankel singular values
- Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter), MLE, and MHE

You can check out the latest version of the source code with the command::

  git clone https://github.com/python-control/python-control.git

You can run the unit tests with `pytest`_ to make sure that everything is
working correctly.  Inside the source directory, run::

  pytest -v

or to test the installed package::

  pytest --pyargs control -v
