Welcome to the Python Control Systems Library (python-control) User
Guide.  This guide contains information on using the python-control
package, including documentation for all functions in the package and
examples illustrating their use.


Package Overview
================

.. automodule:: control
   :noindex:
   :no-members:
   :no-inherited-members:
   :no-special-members:


Installation
============

The `python-control` package can be installed using conda or pip.  The
package requires `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_, and the plotting routines
require `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_.  In addition, some
routines require the `Slycot
<https://github.com/python-control/Slycot>`_ library in order to
implement more advanced features (including some MIMO functionality).

For users with the Anaconda distribution of Python, the following
command can be used::

  conda install -c conda-forge control slycot

This installs `slycot` and `python-control` from conda-forge, including the
`openblas` package.  NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib will also be installed if
they are not already present.

.. note::
   Mixing packages from conda-forge and the default conda channel
   can sometimes cause problems with dependencies, so it is usually best to
   install NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib from conda-forge as well.

To install using pip::

  pip install slycot   # optional
  pip install control

.. note::
   If you install Slycot using pip you'll need a development
   environment (e.g., Python development files, C, and FORTRAN compilers).
   Pip installation can be particularly complicated for Windows.

Many parts of `python-control` will work without `slycot`, but some
functionality is limited or absent, and installation of `slycot` is
recommended. Users can check to insure that slycot is installed
correctly by running the command::

  python -c "import slycot"

and verifying that no error message appears. More information on the
Slycot package can be obtained from the `Slycot project page
<https://github.com/python-control/Slycot>`_.

Alternatively, to install `python-control` from source, first
`download the source code
<https://github.com/python-control/python-control/releases>`_ and
unpack it.  To install in your Python environment, use::

  pip install .

The python-control package can also be used with `Google Colab
<colab.google.com>`_ by including the following lines to import the
control package::

  %pip install control
  import control as ct

Note that Google Colab does not currently support Slycot, so some
functionality may not be available.


Package Conventions
===================

The python-control package makes use of a few naming and calling conventions:

* Function names are written in lower case with underscores between
  words (`frequency_response`).

* Class names use camel case (`StateSpace`, `ControlPlot`, etc) and
  instances of the class are created with "factory functions" (`ss`, `tf`)
  or as the output of an operation (`bode_plot`, `step_response`).

* Functions that return multiple values use either objects (with
  elements for each return value) or tuples.  For those functions that
  return tuples, the underscore variable can be used if only some of
  the return values are needed::

    K, _, _ = ct.lqr(sys)

* Python-control supports both single-input, single-output (SISO)
  systems and multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems, including
  time and frequency responses.  By default, SISO systems will
  typically generate objects that have the input and output dimensions
  suppressed (using the NumPy :func:`numpy.squeeze` function).  The
  `squeeze` keyword can be set to False to force functions to return
  objects that include the input and output dimensions.


Some Differences from MATLAB
============================

Users familiar with the MATLAB control systems toolbox will find much
of the functionality implemented in `python-control`, though using
Python constructs and coding conventions.  The python-control package
makes heavy use of `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org>`_ and `SciPy
<https://www.scipy.org>`_ and many differences are reflected in the
use of those .  A list of general differences between NumPy and MATLAB
can be found `here
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`_.

In terms of the python-control package more specifically, here are
some things to keep in mind:

* Vectors and matrices used as arguments to functions can be written
  using lists, with commas required between elements and column
  vectors implemented as nested lists.  So [1 2 3] must be written as
  [1, 2, 3] and matrices are written using 2D nested lists, e.g., [[1,
  2], [3, 4]].
* Functions that in MATLAB would return variable numbers of values
  will have a parameter of the form `return_\<val\>` that is used to
  return additional data.  (These functions usually return an object of
  a class that has attributes that can be used to access the
  information and this is the preferred usage pattern.)
* You cannot use braces for collections; use tuples instead.
* Time series data have time as the final index (see
  :ref:`time series data conventions <time-series-convention>`).


Documentation Conventions
=========================

This documentation has a number of notional conventions and functionality:

* The left panel displays the table of contents and is divided into
  two main sections: the User Guide, which contains a narrative
  description of the package along with examples, and the Reference
  Manual, which contains documentation for all functions, classes,
  configurable default parameters, and other detailed information.

* Classes, functions, and methods with additional documentation appear
  in a bold, code font that link to the Reference Manual. Example: `ss`.

* Links to other sections appear in blue. Example: :ref:`nonlinear-systems`.

* Parameters appear in a (non-bold) code font, as do code fragments.
  Example: `omega`.

* Example code is contained in code blocks that can be copied using
  the copy icon in the top right corner of the code block.  Code
  blocks are of three primary types: summary descriptions, code
  listings, and executed commands.

  Summary descriptions show the calling structure of commands but are
  not directly executable.  Example::

    resp = ct.frequency_response(sys[, omega])

  Code listings consist of executable code that can be copied and
  pasted into a Python execution environment.  In most cases the
  objects required by the code block will be present earlier in the
  file or, occasionally, in a different section or chapter (with a
  reference near the code block).  All code listings assume that the
  NumPy package is available using the prefix `np` and the python-control
  package is available using prefix `ct`.  Example:

  .. code::

     sys = ct.rss(4, 2, 1)
     resp = ct.frequency_response(sys)
     cplt = resp.plot()

  Executed commands show commands preceded by a prompt string of the
  form ">>> " and also show the output that is obtained when executing
  that code.  The copy functionality for these blocks is configured to
  only copy the commands and not the prompt string or outputs.  Example:

  .. doctest::

     >>> sys = ct.tf([1], [1, 0.5, 1])
     >>> ct.bandwidth(sys)
     np.float64(1.4839084518312828)
