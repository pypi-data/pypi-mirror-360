## Quick Start

```bash
# Check system dependencies
adbh check

# List connected devices
adbh devices

# Enable ADB on a new device (interactive guide)
adbh enable-adb

# Connect a device wirelessly
adbh add-device pair         # First time pairing
adbh add-device wireless     # Connect to paired device

# Take a screenshot
adbh capture screenshot

# View device logs (with multi-device support)
adbh log view               # Select devices interactively
adbh log view -f MyApp      # Filter by app name

# Manage apps
adbh app list               # List all apps
adbh app launch com.example # Launch specific app
adbh app current -w         # Watch current app

# Run shell commands
adbh shell ls /sdcard       # Single device
adbh shell -a whoami        # All devices
```

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Device Log Viewing

View logs from multiple devices simultaneously with color-coded output:

```bash
# Interactive device selection
adbh log view

# When multiple devices are selected, logs are color-coded
# Each device gets a unique color and prefix like:
# [Pixel_6] Log message here...
# [Galaxy_S21] Another log message...

# Save combined logs
adbh log view -s

# Filter across all devices
adbh log view -f "com.myapp"
```

### Wireless ADB Connection

```bash
# First time setup - pair with device
adbh add-device pair
# or with automatic discovery
adbh add-device pair --discover

# Connect to already paired device
adbh add-device wireless 192.168.1.100:5555

# Disconnect wireless device
adbh disconnect -d 192.168.1.100:5555
```

### App Management

```bash
# List all apps (including system apps)
adbh app list -s

# Filter apps by name
adbh app list -f chrome

# Get detailed app info
adbh app info com.android.chrome

# Clear app data (with confirmation)
adbh app clear com.example.app
adbh app clear -c com.example.app  # Cache only
adbh app clear -y com.example.app  # Skip confirmation

# Backup APKs
adbh app backup com.example.app
