Files in this folder contain snippets of code ran to generate the Chebyshev coefficients describing the motion of objects in the MPC's MPCORB.DAT file. They are not intended to be run as standalone scripts and are only meant to guide setup when updating the ephemeris sometime in the future. They are also not stiched into a coherenet pipeline, charitably because I assume different clusters will require different setups and uncharitably because I was sloppy when creating the first ephemeris. This process requires a computing cluster, and the last step (as written) requires holding the entire ephemeris in memory.
