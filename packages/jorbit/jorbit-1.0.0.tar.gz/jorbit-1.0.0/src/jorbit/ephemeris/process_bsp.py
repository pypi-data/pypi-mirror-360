    Note: assumes that there is only one segment for each target/center pair in the SPK
    file. This is valid for planetary ephemerides like DE440, but not necessarily for
    other .bsp files like those generated for specific asteroids, which may have
    multiple segments for the same target/center pair.

    Args:
        center (str):
            The center ID of an ephemeris segment.
        target (str):
            The target ID of an ephemeris segment.
        ephem_file (str):
            The path to the SPK file. Uses astropy's download_file function to download
            and cache the file if it isn't present in the cache.
        earliest_time (Time):
            The start time for our region of interest. Smaller time windows will result
            in smaller in-memory ephemeris objects.
        latest_time (Time):
            The latest time for the ephemeris.

            A tuple containing the Chebyshev coefficients for the given target and
            center. More specifically, the tuple contains
            (init, intlen, coeff), where init is the initial time of the segment,
            intlen is the interval length, and coeff is the Chebyshev coefficients.
