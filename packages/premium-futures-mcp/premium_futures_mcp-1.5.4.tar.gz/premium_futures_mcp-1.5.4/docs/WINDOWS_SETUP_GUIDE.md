   ```
   Wait for all packages to install.

## üîë Step 3: Get Your Binance API Keys

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING: Your API keys are like passwords to your trading account. Keep them secret!**

1. **Login to Binance:**
   - Go to [binance.com](https://binance.com)
   - Log into your account

2. **Create API Key:**
   - Go to Account ‚Üí API Management
   - Click "Create API" 
   - Choose "System Generated"

     - ‚ùå Leave "Enable Withdrawals" DISABLED for security

3. **Save Your Keys:**
   - Copy both the "API Key" and "Secret Key"
   - Store them temporarily in Notepad (we'll use them next)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Configure the Server

1. **Create Config File:**
   - In your `C:\binance-mcp\` folder, create a file named `config.py`
   - Copy this content into it:

```python
# Binance API Configuration
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key_here"

# Optional: Set to True for testnet (paper trading)
USE_TESTNET = False

# Cache settings (default values work fine)
CACHE_DURATION = 60  # seconds
```

2. **Add Your Keys:**
   - Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key
   - Replace `"your_secret_key_here"` with your actual secret key
   - Save the file

3. **Test Your Setup:**
   ```bash
   python -m premium_futures_mcp.server
   ```
   If you see "Server starting..." without errors, you're good to go!
   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

## üìÇ Step 5: Setup VSCode and MCP

1. **Install VSCode Extensions:**
   - Open VSCode
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Install "GitHub Copilot" and "GitHub Copilot Chat"

2. **Create MCP Configuration:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open command palette
   - Type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
   - Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "binance-futures": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "premium_futures_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "C:\\binance-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Change `"C:\\binance-mcp"` to your actual folder path (use double backslashes).

3. **Restart VSCode** to apply the configuration.

## üöÄ Step 6: First Test

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "GitHub Copilot: Open Chat"

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Permission denied" or "API key invalid"
- Double-check your API keys in `config.py`
- Ensure Futures trading is enabled on your API key
- Try regenerating your API keys

### "Module not found" errors
- Make sure you installed requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you're in the correct directory

### "Connection timeout" or network errors
- Check your internet connection
- Some corporate networks block trading APIs
- Try using a VPN if needed

### VSCode doesn't recognize the MCP server
- Verify the path in your VSCode settings is correct
- Restart VSCode completely
- Check that the server starts manually: `python -m premium_futures_mcp.server`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Tips

1. **Start Small:** Begin with tiny position sizes to test everything works
2. **Use Stop Losses:** Always set stop losses to limit potential losses
3. **Test First:** Consider using Binance Testnet first (set `USE_TESTNET = True`)
