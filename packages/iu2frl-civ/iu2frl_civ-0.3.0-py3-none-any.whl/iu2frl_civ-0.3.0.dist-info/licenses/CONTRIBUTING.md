## Developers instructions

This chapter covers the steps required for developers to add new components to this library. Please review all the points before starting editing the library and submitting a MR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not rename the `tests` folder or the `fake_generic.py` file, as those are used for testing the library.

### Device Types

The `DeviceType` enum is a custom implementation for categorizing different types of transceivers.

It currently includes:

- `Generic`:  A generic device type (built using the IC-7300 CI-V manual).
- `IC_706_MK2`: Represents the IC-706 MKII transceiver model.
- `IC_7300`: Represents the IC-7300 transceiver model.
- `IC_821_H`: Represents the IC-821H transceiver model.

### Adding a new device to the library

This process involves three main steps:

- **Update DeviceType Enum**: A new entry will be added to the `DeviceType` enum to reflect the newly added device.
- **Create a Device class**: You will define a new class that will serve as your device plugin.
- **Update package info**: Add an entry in the `pyproject.toml` to register the plugin.
- **Create a test script**: Create a new test script in the `tests` folder to test the new device.
- **Manual build procedure**: Before sending the merge request, please try to build the package locally and make sure everything works.

#### 1. Add Device to the DeviceType Enum

To include your new device in the `DeviceType` enum, update the `iu2frl_civ.enums` file by adding a new member for the new device.

For example:

```python
from enum import Enum


class DeviceType(Enum):
    """Custom implementation for different transceiver"""
    Generic = 0
    IC_706_MK2 = 1
    NewDevice = 99  # New device added here

 [...]
```

#### 2. Create a new Device class

A plugin is a class that represents a specific device. To create a new plugin:

- Create a new file in the `iu2frl_civ/devices/` directory, for example: `iu2frl_civ/devices/newdevice.py`.
  - Naming convention: `devicename_revision.py`, for example: `ic706_mkii.py` (IC-706 with MKII revision) or `ic7300.py` (IC-7300 with no revision)
- Define a new class in the new python file that extends `iu2frl_civ.device_base` for your device and add the required attributes at the end of the file (`device_type`, `device_class`, see below)

The result should be something like this:

```python
"""
Custom class to communicate with ICOM devices using CI-V protocol
This class was built using the section XX of the ICOM AA-BCDEF User Manual
"""

from ..device_base import DeviceBase  # Import the base class

class NewDevice(DeviceBase):
    """Representation of the new device."""
    
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Inherits the setup procedure from the prototype class
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Pass the parameters to the utils library to start the device
        self.utils = Utils(
            self._ser,
            self.transceiver_address,
            self.controller_address,
            self._read_attempts, 
            fake=self.fake
        )

    # Implement device-specific methods here (see topic below)
    [...]

# Required attributes for plugin discovery
device_type = DeviceType.NewDevice # As specified in the DeviceType enum
device_class = NewDevice # Name of the class defined above
```

> [!TIP]
> If your device does not support certain functions (e.g., `power_on()`, `power_off()`, etc.), you do not need to implement them. The library will automatically raise a `NotImplementedError` when any unsupported method is called.

##### Adding methods to the new device

The CI-V documentation will report all the required command bytes to trigger a specific action, for example to start the tuning procedure on an IC-7300, the manual states:

| Cmd. | Sub cmd. | Data |            Description          |
|------|----------|------|---------------------------------|
| 0x1C |   0x01   | 0x00 | Send/read the antenna tuner OFF |
| 0x1C |   0x01   | 0x01 | Send/read the antenna tuner ON  |
| 0x1C |   0x02   | 0x02 | Send/read tuning procedure      |

We can see that the transceiver starts the tuning process when receiving the command bytes `0x1C, 0x01` and the data byte `0x02`, this translates to:

```python
[...]

class NewDevice(DeviceBase):
    """Representation of the new device."""

    [...]

    def tune_antenna_tuner(self) -> bool:
      """
      Starts the antenna tuner tuning process.
      
      Returns:
        True: if command was accepted from the transceiver

      Exceptions:
        CivTimeoutException: if transceiver does not reply within the specified time
      """
      return len(self.utils.send_command(b"\x1C\x01", b"\x02")) > 0

    [...]
```

#### 3. Update pyproject.toml

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not edit the line with `version = "v0.0.0"` as this is automatically set by GitHub when building the new release

Next, you need to register your new device in the `pyproject.toml` file so that it can be discovered and loaded as a plugin.

Open your `pyproject.toml` file and add a new entry under the `[project.entry-points]` section to register your plugin.

for example:

```toml
[project.entry-points."iu2frl_civ.devices"]
generic = "iu2frl_civ.devices.generic"
ic7300 = "iu2frl_civ.devices.ic7300"
ic706_mkii = "iu2frl_civ.devices.ic706_mkii"
newdevice = "iu2frl_civ.devices.newdevice"  # New device that was just added
```

### 4. Create a test script

To test the new device, create a new test script in the `tests` folder. This script should import the new device and test its functionality. Testing should be done without building the package.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to uninstall any version of the library that was previously installed using `pip uninstall iu2frl-civ` or the newly created device will be ignored

- Copy the `fake_generic.py` script as a template and paste it as `newdevice.py` in the `tests` folder.
- Test the new device by running the `newdevice.py` test script and checking the output (without building the package yet).
  - If you have a real device, you can test the new device by running the test script and checking the output by setting the `Fake` parameter to **False** in the `DeviceFactory.get_repository` method.

### 5. Manual build procedure

Before sending the merge request, please try to build the package locally and make sure everything works

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to uninstall any version of the library that was previously installed using `pip uninstall iu2frl-civ` or the newly created device will be ignored

1. Move to the root directory of the project (where the `pyproject.toml` file is located)
2. Install the build tools: `python -m pip install --upgrade build`
3. Build the wheel package: `python -m build`
4. Install the package that was just built: `pip install ./dist/iu2frl_civ-0.0.0.tar.gz`
5. Test the package using the test code in the `tests/fake_generic.py` file (the script will now use the newly built package)
6. Test the package using the code in the test file you just created

### 6. Removing the manually built package

If you need to remove the manually built package, you can do so by running:

1. Uninstall the package: `pip uninstall iu2frl-civ`
2. Confirm the uninstallation when prompted.

### 7. Submit a Merge Request

Once you have tested your new device and everything is working as expected, you can submit a merge request (MR) to the main repository.

Please ensure that your MR includes:

- A clear description of the changes made.
- Any relevant documentation updates.
- A link (or reference) to the test script you created for the new device.

We will review your MR and provide feedback if necessary. If everything looks good, we will merge your changes into the main branch.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you!
