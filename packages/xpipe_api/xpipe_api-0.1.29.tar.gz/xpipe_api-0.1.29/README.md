Python client for the XPipe API. This library is a wrapper for the raw [HTTP API](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/blob/master/openapi.yaml) and intended to make working with it more convenient.

```bash
python3 -m pip install xpipe_api
```

You can find the documentation at https://docs.xpipe.io/guide/python-api.

## Development

To run the test suite, you'll need to define the XPIPE_APIKEY env var.  This will allow the two "log in with the ApiKey 
rather than Local method" tests to work.  Here's the recommended method for running the tests with poetry:

```bash
cd /path/to/xpipe-python-api
poetry install
XPIPE_APIKEY=<api_key> poetry run pytest
```
