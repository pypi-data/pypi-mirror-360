1 The default reading profile
*****************************

The default reading profile displays a 30-second time window (over a
time grid with 1 second major division, and 0.2 second minor division)
of the following bipolar references, with a default amplitude of 110 uV,
in this order:
  1. F4-T4
  2. F4-C4
  3. F3-C3
  4. F3-T3
  5. T4-O2
  6. C4-O2
  7. 8. C3-O1
  9. T3-O1

   Alternatively, a second reading profile displays these derivations:
  1. Fp2-T4
  2. Fp2-C4
  3. Fz-Cz
  4. Fp1-C3
  5. Fp1-T3
  6. T4-O2
  7. C4-O2
  8. Cz-Pz
  9. C3-O1
  10. T3-O1

   When either the anode or cathode of a derivation is missing, then no
signal is displayed at all.

   It displays and lets the user annotate:
  1. Front Sharp Transients;
  2. Anterior Slow Dysrythmia;
  3. Spikes;
  4. Bursts;
  5. Inter-Burst Intervals.

   It allows the user to cycle between two filtering preferences:
  1. A [0.53 Hz, 70 Hz] band-pass filter;
  2. A [0.53 Hz, 35 Hz] band-pass filter.

2 The ad-hoc neonatal file format
*********************************

The neonatal file format is the encoding of an EEG file, where each
observation is on two bytes.  Each recording is copied twice, with two
different filtering parameters (they match the default reading profile):

  1. With a [0.53 Hz, 70 Hz] band-pass filter;
  2. With a [0.53 Hz, 35 Hz] band-pass filter.

   Each version of the signal is the concatenation of the values for the
following 13 electrodes, in this order:

  1. Fp2
  2. F4
  3. T4
  4. C4
  5. O2
  6. Fz
  7. Cz
  8. Pz
  9. Fp1
  10. F3
  11. T3
  12. C3
  13. O1

   For each of these channels, the time sequence of all observations is
stored in a continuous segment.  All channels are expected to be sampled
at 256 Hz, and they are expected to have the exact same number of
observations.

   The encoding of each observation for each channel is the big-endian
2-byte value, scaled and translated so that a stored 0 should mean -1024
uV and a stored 65535 should mean a +1024 uV.

   The file is thus simply a long sequence of 2-byte-encoded electrode
measure, and it is possible to retrieve the value of one electrode at a
specific onset with a particular filter parameter just by following the
conventions laid out in this section.

   Eegviz distributes an R script, ‘convert-to-neonatal’, that can take
a suitable file in the EDF standard and convert it to this ad-hoc
neonatal file format, provided it is sampled correctly.  EDF+
annotations and foreign channels will be discarded, as well as any
patient metadata, obviously.

   When you call ‘convert-to-neonatal’ ‘file1.edf’ ‘file2.edf’ ..., then
the program creates ‘file1.edf.neonatal’ and ‘file2.edf.neonatal’.

   If any channel is sampled at less than 256 Hz, it will be resampled
before filtering, so the size of the converted data may be larger.

3 The ad-hoc CSV format for storing annotations
***********************************************

When a neonatal file is opened, the annotations are expected to be
listed in a companion file whose name is that of the neonatal file with
the ‘.annotations.csv’ extension appended.  This is a header-less CSV
file, where the columns are:

  1. The onset, in seconds;
  2. The duration, in seconds;
  3. The figure class identifier in the Lytonepal ontology;
  4. A semicolon-separated list of electrode identifiers in the
     Lytonepal ontology.

   This companion file is overwritten each time an annotation is
created, modified, or deleted in the visualizer.

   If you have two different sets of annotations, and you want to use
all of them, you can simply concatenate the CSV files (since they do not
have a header).  It can be a bit tedious to do this for multiple files,
which is where the ‘merge-annotations’ program might help.  You invoke
it as:

     merge-annotations [-O root-of-dataset] root-of-dataset-N ...

   It will read all annotations in any of the directories
‘root-of-dataset-N’ and merge the annotations with the current working
directory, or ‘root-of-dataset’ if specified by option ‘-O’.

4 The ad-hoc database format
****************************

In order to train the segmentation detector, a pre-processed dataset is
required.  The format of the dataset is as follows:

   • A header-less CSV file named ‘files.csv’ contains a list of file
     names that belong to the dataset.  It has one column and no header;
   • Next to ‘files.csv’, each sample is a 10-second window of the
     signal with annotations.  It has 2560 rows, 40 columns, and no
     header.  The first 10 columns are the signal values in the montage
     (Fp2-T4, Fp2-C4, Fz-Cz, Fp1-C3, Fp1-T3, T4-O2, C4-O2, Cz-Pz, C3-O1,
     T3-O1), and the remaining 30 columns are the labels.  The labels
     are successions of groups of 3.  The first label in the group is
     the binary presence of FSP, then the binary present of ASD, then
     the binary presence of spike.  Each group is for a derivation.  So
     the 11th column in the CSV corresponds to the binary presence of a
     FSP on derivation Fp2-T4, the 12th column corresponds to the binary
     presence of an ASD on derivation Fp2-T4, and the 14th column
     corresponds to the binary presence of a FSP on derivation Fp2-C4.

   ‘hash-neonatal’ updates the database in the current working directory
by adding windows from all signals ‘.neonatal’ files passed at
command-line.  The companion ‘.neonatal.annotations.csv’ file is also
read to mark segmentation labels.

   It is an error to invoke ‘hash-neonatal’ if the current working
directory is not a dataset (i.e.  the ‘files.csv’ index does not exist).
To create a new dataset, simply run ‘create-neonatal-dataset’
beforehand.

   The additional constraints are also enforced by the ‘hash-neonatal’
program:

   • each signal window is separated from the previous and the next, so
     that no segment of the full EEG is shared by two different windows
     (the gap is 2 seconds);
   • the order of the windows is lost, so it is not possible to
     reassemble the full signal from its parts;
   • the names of the CSV files for each window is the SHA-256 digest of
     the CSV contents;
   • the items in files.csv are sorted by increasing SHA-256 digest
     values;
   • the modification and read file dates are reset to January 1, 2000
     so that the order of processing is lost at file-system level.

5 Visualization commands
************************

If ‘eegviz’ is invoked with command-line arguments, it considers the
first argument to be a file name and opens it.

   Otherwise, a blank window is opened.  This blank window accepts drag
and drops.  Once a file has been dropped, it disappears and the
visualizer appears with the dropped file.

   The visualizer has two modes: the “time” mode is opened by default,
and it lets the user select time bounds for the annotation.  The user
can switch to the “space” mode by pressing the tabulation key, where the
selection of channels can be edited.  Pressing the tabulation key cycles
between these two modes.  The minor time grid has a different color in
time and space modes.

   In both modes, the left and right arrow moves the view by half a
window.  The U key compresses the signal on the time scale, and D
expands it.  Clicking on the bottom minimap of the window moves the view
somewhere else in the signal.

   In time mode, the R key returns the window length to the default
window length according to the profile.

   In space mode, the R key erases the amplitude of the selected
channels and resets it to what is prescribed by the reading profile.

   The time mode lets the user select an interval.  A red vertical bar
always follows the cursor.  Clicking with the left mouse button
somewhere on the plot places the first interval boundary.  Clicking a
second time sets the other boundary.  When the user clicks a third time,
it unsets the boundary that is closest to the cursor.  So, when both
boundaries are set, it is possible to change any of them by first
clicking near the boundary to change, moving the cursor away, and
clicking again.  The ESC key removes both bounds.

   The space mode lets the user select some channels.  Clicking on the
channel toggles its selection.  By default, all channels are selected
(white background), so clicking in space mode will first deselect a
channel (and give it a light grey background).  The A key selects
everything, the Z key selects nothing, and the I key inverts the
selection.

   In space mode, if some channels are selected, then the visualization
modifiers only apply to these channels.  So, it is possible to tune down
the amplitude of all shown selected channels by pressing the down key,
or tune it up by pressing the up key, or change the filter parameters by
hitting the V key.

   When the list of selected channels is correct, and the time bounds
are set, pressing the Enter key in any mode will add an annotation.  The
figure class is set to the figure class of the latest selected
annotation, or the default figure class in the reading profile if no
annotation has been selected.

   To switch from one reading profile to the next, press the space bar.
Derivations in the new profile that were not in the previous one are
automatically deselected.  If an annotation is being edited, it will be
changed to only have the derivations in the new profile.

   Right-clicking in any mode selects the shortest annotation that is
annotated at the time of the cursor (even if the cursor hovers a channel
that has not been selected for the annotation).  When an annotation is
in blue, it is selected.  It is possible to unselect an annotation by
right-clicking at a time with no annotation or by pressing the Escape
key.

   When an annotation is selected, the time bounds are automatically set
to the time extent of the selected annotation, and the list of selected
channels is set to the relevant channels for this annotation.  The
figure class of the annotation is saved to serve as the default for
future annotations.  This lets the user easily copy an annotation:
right-click on the annotation, press the Escape key, select the new
bounds, and press enter.

   When an annotation is selected, any change of the time bounds or
selected channels retrospectively affect the annotation (provided that
at least one channel is still selected).  The figure class can be
changed by pressing the N (for next) or P (for previous) keys.  The
default annotation type is displayed on the bottom of the screen.  Any
new annotation will by default have this type, until you press the N or
P keys.  Pressing the K key will kill the annotation and remove it from
the file.  If this key is hit by mistake, the Enter key will reinstall
the lost annotation because the list of selected channels, time bounds,
and figure class stay the same.

   Finally, pressing Q quits the visualization.

6 The shapes of the neonatal EEG
********************************

Once you have many annotations, you can analyze the shape of the signal
leading to the annotation.  The ‘extrac-shapes’ program will read the
neonatal files passed as command-line arguments, and extract every
annotation made in these in a dataset.  You can also pass ‘-O DIR’ to
process the next files in DIR.  By default, it will work in the current
working directory.  If ‘-’ is passed in the command-line, the list of
file names (1 per line) will be read from standard imput.

   The ‘extract-shapes’ creates lots of files in the output directory.
The ‘files.csv’ is a two-column CSV file, with no header.  The other
files have their hash as their names (in base16) and contain the signal
values within the annotation window, as CSVs with two columns: the
number of observations since the annotation onset, and the value of the
signal in microvolt.  The ‘files.csv’ has three columns: the names of
the signal extracts, the types of annotation, and the annotator.
