        Which virtual machines had the lowest network usage over the last week in the bank, 
        based on Vsphere logs in InfluxDB? To answer this question, follow these steps:
        - Refer to Flux language instructions in the MCP resources {flux_instruction_uri}.
        - Find InfluxDB datasource in the Grafana instance.
        - Find the InfluxDB datasource, bucket and measurement name that relates to Vsphere virtual machines usage in the bank.
        - Find the tag that identifies virtual machines.
        - Construct a query for finding the virtual machines with the lowest network usage using the lowestAverage() Flux function.
        - Present the results.
