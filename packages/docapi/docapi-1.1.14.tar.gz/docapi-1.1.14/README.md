**DocAPI** is an API documentation generation tool based on large language models (LLM), currently supporting Flask and Django frameworks. With DocAPI, you can quickly generate, update, and display API documentation, significantly enhancing development efficiency.

---

## Important Notes

- **Version 1.x.x** introduces significant changes compared to **0.x.x**. Please refer to the latest usage guide below.
- By default, generating or updating documentation requires the API service's dependency environment.
- Use the parameter `--static` for static route scanning that does not depend on the project environment, only supported for Flask projects. The downside is that it may include unused routes in the documentation, suitable for single-page Flask API projects.

---

## Core Features

- **Framework Support**: Automatically scans the route structure of Flask and Django services.
- **Multi-Model Compatibility**: Supports various mainstream commercial and open-source large models.
- **Documentation Operations**: Automatically generates complete documentation and updates parts of the documentation.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generates multi-language API documentation (requires LLM support).
- **Web Display**: Supports displaying API documentation through a web page.
