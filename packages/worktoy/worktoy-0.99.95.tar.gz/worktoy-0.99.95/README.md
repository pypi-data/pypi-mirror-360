# worktoy v0.99.xx

The **worktoy** provides utilities for Python development focused on
reducing boilerplate code, type-safety and readability. Each release is
tested thoroughly on each supported Python version from 3.7* to 3.13.

Note: *Python 3.7 is no longer acceptable for production use as of 2025.
Support for it should not be taken as an endorsement of staying on an
outdated version well past end-of-life.*

# Installation

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install worktoy
```

When version 1.0 drops, nightly builds will be available by including the
`--pre` flag:

```bash
pip install --pre worktoy
```

# Introduction

Python should be easy. Easy to write, but also easy to read. **worktoy**
helps you write Python code that is as easy to read as it is to write.

# Features

Use `AttriBox` to create one-line type-safe attributes or `Field` to
customize attribute access. Instead of parsing `*args` and
`**kwargs`, use `overload` to provide type specific implementations of
the same function.

# Usage

Below is an example implementation of a complex number using **worktoy**.
Please refer to the docstrings for more information on the individual
components.

```python
"""
ComplexNumber provides a class representation of the complex number
using features found in the 'worktoy' library. Briefly, a complex number
has a real and imaginary part both of which represented here as instances
of 'AttriBox'. The class inherits from the 'BaseObject' class allowing it
to overload functions based on types.
