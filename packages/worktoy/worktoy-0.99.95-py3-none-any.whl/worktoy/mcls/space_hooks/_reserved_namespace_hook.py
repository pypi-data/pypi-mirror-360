class ReservedNamespaceHook(AbstractSpaceHook):
  """
  ReservedNameHook prevents redefinition of names that are reserved for
  use by Python or the metaclass system. These names are typically
  populated automatically during class construction and must not be
  reassigned by user code.

  ## Protected Names

  The following names are treated as reserved:

  - `__dict__`              – Internal attribute dictionary
  - `__weakref__`           – Weak reference support slot
  - `__module__`            – Name of the module defining the class
  - `__annotations__`       – Type hint storage
  - `__match_args__`        – Structural pattern matching
  - `__doc__`               – Docstring
  - `__name__`              – Class name
  - `__qualname__`          – Fully qualified class name
  - `__firstlineno__`       – Source line for class definition
  - `__static_attributes__` – Internal metadata used by the metaclass

  ## Behavior

  During namespace population (i.e., when a class body assigns names),
  any attempt to override a name in the reserved list will raise a
  ReservedName exception — *but only if* the name already exists in the
  namespace. This prevents accidental clobbering of values while still
  allowing deferred initialization.

  ## Usage
  To use NameHook, simply declare it in your namespace class:

  class Space(AbstractNamespace):  # Must inherit from AbstractNamespace
    #  Custom namespace class inheriting from AbstractNamespace
    reservedNameHook = ReservedNameHook()  # Register the hook
