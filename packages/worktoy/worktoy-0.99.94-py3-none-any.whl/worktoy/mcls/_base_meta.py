  """
  BaseMeta is a simple extension of AbstractMetaclass that overrides
  the default class body namespace with `BaseSpace`, a custom namespace
  implementation.

  ## Purpose

  This metaclass does not introduce any behavior of its own beyond
  enabling namespace hooks defined in `BaseSpace`, such as `OverloadHook`,
  `PreClassHook`, `NameHook`, and `ReservedNameHook`.

  It serves as a ready-to-use entry point for classes that require
  hook-driven behavior during class construction without writing a custom
  metaclass.

  ## Example

      class MyClass(metaclass=BaseMeta):
        ...
