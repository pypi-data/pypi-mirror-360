"""Process trading signals for backtesting.

This module converts trading signals into executed trades by simulating
market interactions according to risk management rules. It handles:

1. Signal matching (pairing entry and exit signals)
2. Risk management (position sizing, time constraint, take-profit and stop-loss levels)
3. Trade simulation (calculating exact entry/exit points and results)
4. Portfolio tracking (recording changes in capital and asset holdings)

The core functionality is encapsulated in `process_signals()`, which transforms
a sequence of raw trading signals into a list of executed trades under historical market data.
