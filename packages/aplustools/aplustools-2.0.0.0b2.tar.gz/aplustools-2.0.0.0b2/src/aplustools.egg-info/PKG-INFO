(If you have problems with the package please use `py -3.12 -m pip install aplustools[all]>=2.0.0.0 --upgrade --user`)
(The standard shortform for aplustools is aps, so please use ```import aplustools as aps``` for consistency)

Can currently run tests with ```aps tests run tests/ -minimal``` and show a basic help using ```aps help```.

For more detailed usage and examples, check out our [documentation](https://github.com/adalfarus/aplustools/wiki).

## Naming convention, dependencies and library information
[PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

For modules I use 'lowercase', classes are 'CapitalizedWords' and functions and methods are 'lower_case_with_underscores'.

### Information
- Additional information will be added in the full release.
