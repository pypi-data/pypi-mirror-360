# I'm sorry Cady, I'm afraid I can't do that.

In an early scene in the film M3GAN 2.0 (Blumhouse 2025),
12-year-old Cady is seen attempting to import morality,
and getting an error that the package does not exist.

What is not shown is, if that system included *uncurated*
third-party packages in its search, 'morality' could have
done literally *anything*.

Thankfully I managed to get there first in PyPI so this
function does nothing.  But someone else could have given
you a Trojan horse, which would eventually be removed
from the library, but removal can take time, so you
should always *check* packages before you use them!

The purpose of this package is simply to serve as a
gentle warning that you weren't supposed to imitate what
Cady did in that scene :)
