# Installation

`pip install jolly-roger`

# About

This package attempts to flag visibilities that are contaminated by the Sun and uses a fairly simple heuristic based on the geometry of an interferometer.

In short, `jolly_roger` flags based on the projected baseline length should the array be tracking the Sun. The projected baseline length between some phased direction being tracked and the Sun can be significantly different. `jolly_roger` attempts to leverage this by only flagging data where the projected baseline length is between some nominal range that corresponds to angular scales associated with the Sun.

`jolly_roger` makes no guarentess about removing all contaminated visibilities, nor does it attempt to peel/subtract the Sun from the visibility data.

## How does it work?

`jolly_roger` will recompute the (u,v,w)-coordinates of a measurement set as if it were tracking the Sun, from which (u,v)-distances are derieved for each baseline and timestep. An updated `FLAG` column can then be inserted into the measurement set suppressing visibilities that would be sensitive to a nominated range of angular scales.

## Example

`jolly_roger` has a CLI entry point that can be called as:

```
jolly_flagger scienceData.EMU_1141-55.SB47138.EMU_1141-55.beam00_averaged_cal.leakage.ms --min-horizon-limit-deg '-2' --max-horizon-limit-deg 30 --min-scale-deg 0.075
```

Here we are flagging visibilities that correspond to instances where:
- the Sun has an elevation between -2 and 30 degrees, and
- they are sensitive to angular scales between 0.075 and 1.0 segrees.
