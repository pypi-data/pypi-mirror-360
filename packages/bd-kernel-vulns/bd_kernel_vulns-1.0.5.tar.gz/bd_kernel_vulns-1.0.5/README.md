# INTRODUCTION
## OVERVIEW OF BD_KERNEL_VULNS

This utility accepts a file containing compiled kernel source files (or folders) to filter
the vulnerabilities associated with the 'Linux Kernel' components in a Black Duck SCA project version.

Vulnerabilities which reference a kernel source file, but which do not match against the files/folders 
in the supplied kernel source file will be marked as remediated. The default remediation status is 'Not Affected', although
this is only supported in BD versions 2025.1 and beyond, so for other BD server versions vulnerabilities will be marked
'Ignored'.

1. Create virtualenv
2. Run `pip3 install bd_kernel_vulns --upgrade`

Alternatively, if you want to build and install the utility locally:

1. clone the repository
2. Create virtualenv
3. Build the utility `python3 -m build`

and source_file_name_only are optional.

## COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

    REQUIRED:
     --blackduck_url BLACKDUCK_URL
            Black Duck server URL (REQUIRED - will also use BLACKDUCK_URL env var)
     --blackduck_api_token BLACKDUCK_API_TOKEN
            Black Duck API token (REQUIRED - will also use BLACKDUCK_API_TOKEN env var)
     -p PROJECT, --project PROJECT 
            Black Duck project to create (REQUIRED)
     -v VERSION, --version VERSION
            Black Duck project version to create (REQUIRED)
    -k KERNEL_SOURCE_FILE, --kernel_source_file KERNEL_SOURCE_FILE
            File containing list of source files (or folders) within the kernel (one per line).

    OPTIONAL:
     --blackduck_trust_cert
            Black Duck trust server cert (can use BLACKDUCK_TRUST_CERT env var)
     --folders
            Supplied list is kernel source folders (not source files)
     --kernel_comp_name
            Alternate kernel component name (default 'Linux Kernel')
     --remediation_status
            Vulnerability Remediation Status to apply - Default NOT_AFFECTED
            (Options REMEDIATION_COMPLETE, NOT_AFFECTED, MITIGATED, DUPLICATE, IGNORED, 
            PATCHED, NEW, UNDER_INVESTIGATION, NEEDS_REVIEW, AFFECTED, REMEDIATION_REQUIRED)  
     --remediation_justification
            Vulnerability Remediation Justification - Default NO_CODE
            (Options NO_COMPONENT, NO_CODE, NOT_CONTROLLED, NOT_EXECUTED,
            ALREADY_MITIGATED, MITIGATION, NO_FIX_PLANNED,
            NONE_AVAILABLE, VENDOR_FIX, WORKAROUND - only applied if NOT_AFFECTED 
            or AFFECTED selected for remediation status
     --source_file_names_only
            Match only source file names from vulnerabilities against the supplied source file list
            (default is to match full folder names for example 'scripts/mod/file2alias.c' - use with caution
            as can match vulnerabilities by the same kernel source name in different modules)

## REMEDIATION STATUS
The utility applies the default remediation status NOT_AFFECTED (with justification NO_CODE) which is a new 
remediation status available since 2025.1.0. The script identifies the Black Duck server version and modifies the 
remediation status to 'IGNORED' for versions prior to 2025.1.0 automatically.

## KERNEL SOURCE FILES

The utility requires a list of kernel source files in a supplied file.
The source file list should include the path of each source file ending in the correct extension
for example 'scripts/mod/file2alias.c'.  Folder separators should use forward slash '/'.
Use the option `--source_file_names_only` to only match the source file name ignoring folders.

## KERNEL SOURCE FOLDERS

If the `--folders` option is specified, then a list of kernel source file folders is expected in the kernel_source_file, and
kernel source files referenced in vulnerabilities will be matched based on the folders where they exist only.
For example the file 'scripts/mod/file2alias.c' will match the folder 'scripts', 'mod' or 'scripts/mod'.
Leading and trailing '/' separators are not required.

## OBTAINING KERNEL SOURCE FILES

### FROM RUNNING LINUX IMAGE

The `lsmod` and `modinfo` commands can be used to report the compiled objects in the running kernel.

An example bash script to produce the list of kernel source files is shown below:

    lsmod | while read module otherfields
    do
        modinfo $module | grep '^filename:' | sed -e 's/filename:  *//g' -e 's/\.ko\.zst//g'
    done > kfiles.lst

### FROM YOCTO BUILD

The [bd_scan_yocto_via_sbom](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/bd_scan_yocto_via_sbom) utility is recommended to 
scan Yocto projects, and the `--process_kernel_vulns` option will call this utility to filter kernel vulnerabilities.

However, if you want to use this utility directly on a Yocto project then processing the module image archive can 
generate the list of compiled source files as follows:

1. Locate the modules image archive file for the specific build (usually beneath the poky/build/tmp/deploy/images folder - for example `modules--6.12.31+git0+f2f3b6cbd9_fee8195f84-r0-qemux86-64-20250608200614.tgz`)
2. Extract the list of modules from the file using `tar tf FILE | grep '.ko$' | sed -e 's/\.ko$/.c/g' > kfiles.lst`

### FROM BUILDROOT BUILD

1. Locate the Kernel Build Directory - for example _<buildroot_root_directory>/output/build/linux-<kernel_version>/_
2. Identify Compiled Object Files (.o files) by running `find <buildroot_root_directory>/output/build/linux-<kernel_version>/ -name "*.o" | sed -e 's/\.o$/.c/g' > kfiles.lst`
