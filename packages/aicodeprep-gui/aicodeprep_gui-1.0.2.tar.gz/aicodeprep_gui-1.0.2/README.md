**Latest Version: 1.0.0 (June 20, 2025)**

## What is aicodeprep-gui?

aicodeprep-gui is a cross-platform desktop application that helps developers quickly gather and share their project code with AI chatbots. Instead of manually copying and pasting multiple files just to ask a question, this tool automatically collects relevant code files into a single 'block' + text file, copies it to your clipboard automatically, and formats it with AI-friendly tags. READY... to paste right into an AI chat, or multiple ones (they are still usually free!).

You can set presets which quickly add on text to what you typed, so you can do things like click the Cline button to tell the AI you want it to reply with a nice prompt you can just paste right into Cline to make fast changes without all the manual copying, pasting, typing over and over..

Basically what this does is get rid of all the little annoying frictions between me asking my question, and giving the AI the code i'm asking about. Without this tool I would have to open each code file, copy, paste it into AI Studio/Gemini/whatever, type the same questions I ask over and over.. I hate the tedious stuff, I want to spend my brain power on better things. That's what this helps with.

ChatGPT, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, I have like 15 tabs open of different web chat's like this and most are totally free to use.

This helps you "vibe code" faster. Only need to paste one time. It will automatically guess as to which code files you will want for context, but allow you to fine tune it. This might seem pointless ohhh but its not. All of the available agents in IDEs will make the AI dumber by giving it a bunch of information unrelated to your problem.

Or, it won't give it enough information or context from your project.

When you use web chat interfaces, you don't have the giant hidden prompts telling the AI all about how to be an agent, how to edit files, etc. The more of this that is sent with your prompt, the dumber it will be. If you ask a question or give it a task via the web chat interface its almost always going to be smarter. This app gets rid of most of the friction between you giving the AI your code files and questions/tasks.

There are many other similar tools that are command line only, and don't have smart file checking and prefs saving, saving which files you chose for next time (when you check more files or uncheck certain ones, it will remember, for next time - this is what the .aicodepre-gui file is for). It even saves the window size and where you dragged the bar in the UI, so you won't have to do that again. Saving time and being less annoying, makes me happy, and probably makes you happy too.

It supports **Windows**, **macOS (M1+)**, and **Linux** with context menu/right-click integration.

## Screenshots & Usage

Update coming soon - but you can look at the older version and get an idea for how it is used at these links:

[https://wuu73.org/aicp - the old homepage for the app with old screenshots](https://wuu73.org/aicp)

[Guide on how to code free/cheap, workflow info, etc](https://wuu73.org/blog/guide.html)

## Installation

### macOS

Currently glitchy with pipx, but you can just throw the whole codebase into AI and ask how to get it up and running.
Should work on any Mac (before was limited to M series)

### Windows

py -m pip install --user pipx
py -m pipx ensurepath

close that terminal window, and open a fresh new one

//pipx install --pip-args="--extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/" aicodeprep-gui==1.0.1
pipx install aicodeprep-gui

It should say success or something similar or done.

Now that it is installed, you can type 'aicp' + enter in a terminal to run it or aicp path/to/folder/
also aicodeprep-gui works instead of aicp. aicp is shorter, that's why its included.

#### Install right-click context menu (optional)

There should be a thing in the File menu for this

1. Run the Windows installer from the releases page.
2. Follow the installation wizard.
3. To use: Right-click in any folder's blank space in Windows File Explorer ‚Üí `aicodeprep-gui`.
4. Restart Windows if the context menu does not appear immediately.
5. Select/deselect files and folders, then click **Process Selected**.
6. Your selected code will be saved to `fullcode.txt` and copied to the clipboard.

### Linux

Version 1.0.0+:

#### Update package lists and upgrade existing packages

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

#### Install pip for Python 3

sudo apt install python3-pip -y

#### Install and Configure pipx

Now, use pip to install pipx. It's best to install it in your user space to avoid needing sudo for Python packages.

# Install pipx

pip3 install --user pipx

# Add the pipx bin directory to your system's PATH

# This command injects the necessary line into your shell's startup file (.bashrc)

pipx ensurepath

#### IMPORTANT: After running pipx ensurepath, you must close and reopen your terminal for the PATH changes to take effect.

Older version:

1. Download the Linux package from the releases page.
2. Follow the installation instructions in the included README.
3. Use via command line: `aicodeprep-gui [directory]`
4. File manager context menu integration may be available depending on your desktop environment.

### Python Installation

```older version - sti
pip install aicodeprep-gui
aicodeprep-gui  # Run in current directory
aicodeprep-gui /path/to/project  # Run in specific directory

or:

aicp
aicp path/to/project/code/etc
```

## Configuration

You can customize file extensions, directories, and exclusion patterns via an `aicodeprep-gui.toml` file in your project folder. This will override the default configuration.

Example `aicodeprep-gui.toml`:

```toml
max_file_size = 2000000

code_extensions = [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".html", ".css"]

exclude_patterns = [
    "build/",
    "dist/",
    "*.log",
    "temp_*"
]

default_include_patterns = [
    "README.md",
    "main.py"
]
```

Refer to `aicodeprep-gui/data/default_config.toml` for all available configuration options.
