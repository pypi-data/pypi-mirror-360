PGM
  [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model): 
  A probabilistic graphical model (PGM) or structured probabilistic model is a probabilistic model for which a graph 
  expresses the truncated dependence structure between random variables. 
  They are commonly used in probability theory, statistics—particularly Bayesian statistics—and machine learning.
