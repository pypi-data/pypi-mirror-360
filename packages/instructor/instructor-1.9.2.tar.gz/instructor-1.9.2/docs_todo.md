2. Created documentation templates for providers, concepts, and cookbooks
3. Added documentation guidelines to CLAUDE.md
4. Created a dedicated Getting Started guide
5. Added a comprehensive FAQ
6. Improved Tutorials index page 
7. Updated mkdocs.yml to include new pages

## Priority Order
1. Fix critical issues (missing providers, broken links)
2. Standardize templates and formats
3. Improve getting started experience
4. Enhance content organization
5. Add detailed guides and diagrams

## Code Example Standardization
- All examples must include complete import statements (standard lib → third-party → local)
- Environment setup must be shown (API keys, etc.) or referenced
- Use consistent model versions (latest stable for each provider)
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Use proper type annotations
- Add docstrings for complex functions
- Show expected output in consistent format
- Specify mode explicitly when not using defaults
- Include validation checks where helpful
- Follow Black formatting conventions
