## About

`AppCategorizer` is a **Python package** that takes an application name as input and provides its most suitable category. It achieves this by **fetching application data from multiple sources** including Snapcraft, Flathub, Apple Store, GOG, Itch.io, and MyAbandonware. This comprehensive data collection is then processed using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to accurately determine and assign the most suitable category to the application.

The project is entirely written in Python.

## Features

`AppCategorizer` offers a robust set of features to streamline the application categorization process:

*   **Multi-source Data Fetching**: Gathers comprehensive application information from **over 5 different sources**, ensuring a broad and rich dataset for categorization.
*   **Intelligent Tag Normalization**: Cleans and standardizes diverse tags obtained from various data sources, ensuring consistent and high-quality input for the categorization process.
*   **AI-Powered Categorization**: Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** to intelligently analyze application data and assign the most appropriate category.
*   **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Provides a **simple and intuitive CLI** for quick, on-the-fly application categorization, making it easy to use directly from the terminal.
*   **Python API**: Offers **programmatic access**, allowing seamless integration into other Python projects, scripts, and automated workflows.

## Installation

You can install `AppCategorizer` directly using pip:

```bash
pip install AppCategorizer
```


## Quick Start

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Use the `AppCategorizer` command directly in your terminal for quick categorization:

```bash
# For single-word application names:
AppCategorizer Facebook
# Expected Output: Social Networking

# For multi-word application names (enclose in quotes):
AppCategorizer 'Google Chrome'
# Expected Output: Web Browser
```


## How it Works

`AppCategorizer` operates by first **fetching relevant application data** from a diverse set of online repositories, which includes Snapcraft, Flathub, Apple Store, GOG, Itch.io, and MyAbandonware. Once this raw data is collected, it undergoes an **intelligent tag normalization process** designed to clean and standardize various tags, ensuring uniformity and reliability. Finally, the normalized data is fed into an **Artificial Intelligence model** that employs **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** to accurately analyze the information and assign the most suitable category to the software application.
