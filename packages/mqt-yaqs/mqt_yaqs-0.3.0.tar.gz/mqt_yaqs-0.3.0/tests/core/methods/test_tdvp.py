"""Tests for Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) methods in YAQS.

This module contains unit tests for verifying various components of TDVP-based methods,
including:

- Tensor decomposition (splitting and merging) routines for Matrix Product States (MPS)
   and Matrix Product Operators (MPO).
- Environment updates (left and right) and projection routines essential to efficient TDVP implementations.
- Single-site and two-site TDVP algorithms for evolving quantum states under given Hamiltonians.

The tests ensure that:
- Tensor reshaping and decomposition operations maintain numerical accuracy.
- Environment tensors are updated with correct shapes and dimensions.
- TDVP routines yield canonical MPS states with the correct orthogonality center.

These tests confirm the correctness and stability of TDVP-based simulations within the YAQS framework.
