LangOps is a modular SDK for building AI-powered DevOps tools.
It provides a flexible framework for parsing logs, interacting with LLMs, and analyzing failure patterns across CI/CD pipelines.
Designed with extensibility in mind, it supports plug-and-play parsers, model-agnostic LLM clients, and clean abstractions for building intelligent automation agents.
