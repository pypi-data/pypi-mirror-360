## The Problem

You have a timestamp from somewhere (a database, elapsed timer, whatever) that you need to cleanly display.

Google presents a variety of solutions which are either half baked, partially broken, unnecessarily complex or just plain ugly.

I got tired of implementing this in different ways across different projects, so here we are.

```
>>> from tformat import format_time
>>> format_time(290390, ms=False)
'3 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes and 50 seconds'

>>> format_time(36400000, ms=True)
'10 hours, 6 minutes and 40 seconds'

>>> format_time(time.time())
'2662 weeks, 2 days, 20 hours, 8 minutes and 14 seconds'
```

## Installation

From pip:
```
pip install tformat
```
Or from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/cartertemm/tformat.git
cd tformat
pip install .
```

Or just copy the file (or it's contents) to where ever it fits in your project.

## Licensing
