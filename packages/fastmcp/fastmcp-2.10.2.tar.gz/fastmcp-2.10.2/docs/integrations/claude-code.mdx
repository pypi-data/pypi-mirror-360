Claude Code supports MCP servers through multiple transport methods, allowing you to extend Claude's capabilities with custom tools, resources, and prompts from your FastMCP servers.

<Note>
Claude Code supports both local and remote MCP servers with flexible configuration options. See the [Claude Code MCP documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) for other transport methods.
</Note>

<Tip>
Claude Code provides built-in MCP management commands to easily add, configure, and authenticate your FastMCP servers.

## Create a Server

You can create FastMCP servers using STDIO transport, remote HTTP servers, or local HTTP servers. This example shows one common approach: running an HTTP server locally for development.

```python server.py
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

## Connect to Claude Code

Start your server and add it to Claude Code:

```bash
# Start your server first
python server.py
```

Then add it to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add dice --transport http http://localhost:8000/mcp/
```

## Using Your Server

Once connected, Claude Code will automatically discover and use your server's tools when relevant:

```
Roll some dice for me
```

Claude will call your `roll_dice` tool and provide the results. If your server provides resources, you can reference them with `@` mentions like `@dice:file://path/to/resource`.
