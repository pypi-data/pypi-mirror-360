    Collaboratively write or improve a document through iterative Q&A sessions.
    
    This function uses an AI assistant to identify gaps in a document and ask targeted
    questions to gather missing information. It then integrates the answers to create
    a more complete document. The process repeats until the user stops providing answers.
    
    Args:
        document_path (str): Path to the document file. If the file doesn't exist,
                           a new document will be created. If it exists, the content
                           will be iteratively improved.
        document_type (str, optional): Description of what type of document this is
                                     (e.g., "functional specification", "project plan",
                                     "research paper"). If not provided, will be inferred
                                     from the filename by removing underscores and extension.
        max_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of questions the assistant will ask the user
    
    Returns:
        None: The function prints the updated document content after each iteration
              and continues until the user provides an empty response.
    
    Example:
        >>> iterative_document_writer("/tmp/project_spec.md", "project specification")
        >>> iterative_document_writer("/tmp/meeting_notes.txt")  # type inferred as "meeting notes"
