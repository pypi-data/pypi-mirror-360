## Overview

**GraphMyTunes builds insightful visualizations using the metadata in your Apple Music (formerly known as iTunes) library.** Its goal is to provide data to help you better understand your music listening and curation habits.

## Requirements

- **Apple Music app** for Mac or Windows
- **Python** (tested primarily with 3.13, but probably works fine with 3.9 and higher)

## Quick Start

Follow these 3 steps to get started analyzing your music library.

### Step 1: Install Python and GraphMyTunes

1. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python for Mac or Windows.
1. Use pip to install GraphMyTunes:

        pip install GraphMyTunes

### Step 2: Export your music library to XML

1. In the Apple Music app, choose **File > Library > Export Library**.
1. Save the XML file to a convenient location.

> [!TIP]
> **Tip:** I use a date-based filename like `2025-07-05.xml` so that I can save multiple snapshots of my library over time.

### Step 3: Run GraphMyTunes

1. Provide the path to the XML you just saved to GraphMyTunes for analysis.

        GraphMyTunes ~/Music/2025-07-05.xml

1. When processing is complete, view your graphs in the `output` folder.

## Featured Analyses

GraphMyTunes includes 40+ built-in ways to analyze your music collection, including but not limited to:

## Limitations and scope

- At this time, GraphMyTunes development is focused around **Apple Music only**. There are likely other solutions that serve those with Spotify, Amazon, Pandora, or Last.fm libraries.

- GraphMyTunes is **limited by the metadata exported by the Music app.** Specifically, the exported XML does not include every date/time you played a track; it only includes the _most recent_ play date/time. Therefore, GraphMyTunes will not be able to surface some listening trends (for example, finding songs you used to listen to a lot but now listen to infrequently).

- GraphMyTunes **does not include single-metric metadata rankings that can easily be done in the Music app itself** (for example, listing the top tracks by play count). If you want these, go to the Music app's "Songs" view, adjust the view options to include the desired columns, and sort ascending or descending by that column. GraphMyTunes aims to provide ways to aggregate or group data in ways that the Music app cannot do.
