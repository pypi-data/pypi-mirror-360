## [0.3.0] – 2025-07-01

=== "✨ Highlights"
    - 🖇️ Refactored API for more modular LLM integration.
    - 🐛 Fixed intermittent crash on empty PFD report uploads.

=== "📝 Details"
    - **Added:** New `produce_spans` flag for detailed span extraction during LLM-powered feature extraction.
    - **Changed:** Unified the feature extraction and theme assignment APIs—breaking change, see migration below.
    - **Fixed:** Empty DataFrame uploads now return a user-friendly error instead of crashing.
    - **Docs:** Improved developer guide for custom extractors.

!!! Important
    **Breaking change in 0.3.0:**  
    The feature extraction API now requires explicit column selection. Old scripts may fail.


???+ note "Migration Guidance"
    Update your function calls from:
    ```python
    extractor.extract_features(reports)
    ```
    to:
    ```python
    extractor.extract_features(reports, include_date=True, include_concerns=True)
    ```
    See the [API reference](api.md) for details.
