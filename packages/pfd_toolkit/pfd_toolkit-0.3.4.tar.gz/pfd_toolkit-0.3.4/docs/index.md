*PFD Toolkit* is an open-source Python package for bulk extraction and analysis of Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports from coroners in England and Wales. Designed for researchers, policymakers, and analysts, it converts PFD reports into an 'engine of insight'.

What used to take months (or even years!) of manual work can now be reduced to a matter of minutes. PFD Toolkit lets you:

1. Download structured PFD report datasets
2. Filter reports to identify research-relevant cases (just type in a phrase such as "road safety")
3. Generate short summaries of reports
4. Automatically discover recurring topics or themes
5. Output clean tables ready for charts or further analysis

Here is a sample of the PFD dataset:

| url                        | date       | coroner    | area                        | receiver                | investigation           | circumstances                 | concerns                   |

Each row is an individual report, while each column reflects a section of the report. For more information on the structure of these reports, see [here](pfd_reports.md#what-do-pfd-reports-look-like).

## Why use PFD Toolkit for PFD Report Analysis?

PFD reports have long served as urgent public warnings — issued when coroners identified risks that could, if ignored, lead to further deaths. Yet despite being freely available, these reports are chronically underused. 

This is for one simple reason: PFD reports are a _pain_ to analyse. 

Common issues include:

 * No straightforward way to download report content in bulk

 * No reliable way of querying reports to find cases relevant to a specific research question

 * Reports being inconsistent in format (e.g. many reports are low quality digital scans)

 * No system for surfacing recurring issues raised across multiple reports

 * Widespread miscategorisation of reports, creating research limitations


As a result, research involving PFD reports demanded months, or even years, of manual admin. Researchers were forced to sift through hundreds/thousands of reports one-by-one, wrestle with absent metadata, and code themes by hand. 

PFD Toolkit offers a solution to each of these issues, helping researchers load, screen and analyse PFD report data - all in a matter of minutes.
