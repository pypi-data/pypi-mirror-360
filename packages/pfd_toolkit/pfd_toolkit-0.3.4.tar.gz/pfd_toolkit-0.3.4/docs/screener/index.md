# Screen or filter reports based on a query

![Screener](../assets/screener.png)


The `Screener` class filters PFD reports according to a plain‑English query. This class lets you submit a search-query (e.g. "Deaths in police custody") and have the model screen thousands of reports for possible matches.

The following pages cover how to use it:

- [Getting started](basics.md) – run your first screen and understand why an LLM beats simple keyword search.
- [Additional options](options.md) – annotate instead of filtering and control which columns are read.
- [Tips for writing a good search query](tips.md) – craft prompts that get accurate results.
