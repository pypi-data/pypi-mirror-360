**Summary of Changes:**
The provided commits introduce a new `server` package and significantly refactor the agent's interaction with tools and the LLM, aiming to improve responsiveness, efficiency, and configurability.

### Main Themes and Innovations:

1.  **Introduction of a Dedicated Server Package (`packages/server`)**: A major architectural change is the creation of a `server` package, which appears to be designed to host the Coder Agent. This suggests a shift towards a more modular and potentially distributed architecture, allowing the agent to run as a separate service.
2.  **Enhanced Agent Responsiveness and Continuous Processing**: The agent's core loop (`CoderAgentExecutor` in `agent.ts`) has been refactored to enable continuous processing of agent turns and immediate reaction to tool results. Previously, the agent might have waited for user input to process tool responses. This change allows for more autonomous and fluid agent operation.
3.  **Improved Tool Call Handling and Efficiency**:
    *   **Batching Tool Calls**: Tool call requests from the LLM are now collected and scheduled as a single batch, reducing the overhead of individual scheduling operations.
    *   **Immediate Tool Response Processing**: Tool responses are processed as soon as they are available, rather than being buffered or waiting for explicit user interaction.
4.  **Configurability and Extensibility**:
    *   **MCP Server Support**: The agent can now load and utilize tools from external Model-Centric Protocol (MCP) servers, significantly extending its capabilities and allowing for integration with a wider range of services.
    *   **Dynamic Workspace Changes**: The agent can change its working directory based on client-provided settings, enabling a single agent instance to manage multiple projects or contexts.
    *   **"YOLO Mode" for Tool Confirmations**: A development/testing feature that allows automatic approval of all tool confirmations, useful for unattended runs.
5.  **Improved Observability and Type Safety**:
    *   **Winston-based Logging**: `console.log` statements are replaced with a more robust Winston logger, providing better control over log levels, formats, and destinations (including temporary files).
    *   **Discriminated Unions for Agent Events**: Agent event handling is refactored to use discriminated unions, enhancing type safety and making event handling more extensible.
    *   **Centralized Task Status Updates**: All task status updates are now routed through a single, public method in the `Task` class, ensuring consistency and proper metadata inclusion.

### Notable Code Refactoring and Architectural Changes:

*   **`packages/server/src/agent.ts` and `packages/server/src/task.ts`**: These files are central to most of the changes, undergoing significant modifications related to agent execution flow, tool call management, and state updates.
*   **Removal of `task_tool_scheduler_manager.ts`**: This file, initially introduced for wiring tool calling, appears to have been refactored out or its functionality integrated elsewhere, indicating an evolution in the tool scheduling architecture.
*   **Refactoring of `a2alib` package**: While not directly part of the `server` package, `a2alib` (likely "Agent-to-Agent library") has been cleaned up, with old agents removed and its structure refined, suggesting it's becoming a foundational component for agent communication.

### Potential Impact or Value:

These changes are geared towards building a more robust, efficient, and flexible AI agent. The ability to process tool calls continuously and in batches will lead to a more responsive and less "chatty" agent experience. The support for MCP servers and dynamic workspace changes opens up significant possibilities for integrating the agent into larger ecosystems and handling complex, multi-project workflows. The improved logging and type safety will aid in development, debugging, and maintaining the codebase. The introduction of the `server` package lays the groundwork for deploying the agent as a standalone service, potentially enabling new deployment models and use cases.

- Last updated: 2025-07-01T08:11:02+00:00

**Summary of Changes:**
The developer has significantly overhauled the `generate-commit-message` tool, focusing on robustness, error handling, and user experience.

**Main Themes:**
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Extensive work has been done to make the commit message generation process more reliable, particularly concerning Git interactions and AI model responses. This includes improved race condition protection, intelligent staging strategies, and comprehensive error handling.
- **Improved Error Handling and User Feedback:** A major focus has been on providing clear, actionable error messages for various failure scenarios, ranging from Git command failures to AI API errors (network issues, authentication, content policy, rate limiting).
- **Refactored Codebase and Testing:** The core logic for generating commit messages has been refactored for clarity and maintainability, accompanied by a substantial expansion of the test suite to cover a wider range of edge cases and error conditions.
- **Large Diff Truncation:** A new feature to truncate large diffs before sending them to the LLM has been introduced to prevent exceeding token limits.

**Significant New Features or Improvements:**
- **Intelligent Staging Strategy:** The tool now intelligently determines whether to commit only staged changes or to automatically stage all relevant changes (unstaged/untracked) based on the current Git repository state.
- **Interactive Confirmation with File List:** Users are now presented with the generated commit message and a list of files to be committed for confirmation, improving transparency and reducing errors.
- **Pre-commit Hook Retry Logic:** The tool can now handle modifications made by pre-commit hooks, retrying the commit process if necessary.
- **Robust JSON Parsing:** Improved parsing of AI responses, including handling JSON within markdown code blocks, plain text JSON, multiple JSON objects, and JSON with escaped characters.
- **Sensitive Information Detection:** The AI response now includes a flag to indicate if sensitive information is detected in the changes, allowing for appropriate user warnings.
- **Diff Truncation for LLM:** Large diffs are now truncated to prevent exceeding LLM token limits, ensuring the commit message generation process can complete.
- **Enhanced Git Command Execution:** Switched to more direct `git` command execution for better control, and refined error detection for Git command failures using `err.code`.

**Notable Code Refactoring or Architectural Changes:**
- **Type Definitions:** Introduction of new type definitions for Git state and cached commit data for improved code clarity and maintainability.
- **Refined Caching Logic:** The caching mechanism for commit data has been enhanced to ensure accuracy and prevent race conditions, particularly by validating the Git index state.
- **Streamlined Commit Message Handling:** The `git commit` command now uses `'-F -'` to pass the commit message via stdin, which is more reliable for complex messages.
- **Modular Error Handling:** Error handling is now more granular, with specific error messages for different types of failures (e.g., EPIPE for stdin, network errors, authentication errors).

**Potential Impact or Value of the Changes:**
These changes significantly improve the usability, reliability, and robustness of the automated commit message generation tool. Users will experience:
- **Fewer Failed Commits:** Due to better error handling, intelligent staging, and pre-commit hook retries.
- **More Accurate Commit Messages:** Enhanced AI prompting and validation ensure higher quality output.
- **Better User Experience:** Clear error messages, interactive confirmation, and file lists provide more control and transparency.
- **Increased Stability:** The ability to handle large diffs and various network/API issues makes the tool more resilient.
- **Improved Maintainability:** The refactored codebase with better type definitions and testing will make future development easier.

  - [PR #1](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/2796)


- Last updated: 2025-07-01T09:38:01+00:00

**Summary of Changes:**
The recent changes to the repository, primarily within the `packages/cli` and `packages/core` directories, focus on enhancing the stability, maintainability, and user experience of the Gemini CLI. The key themes are improved error handling, better resource management (especially memory), more robust authentication, and general code hygiene through refactoring and clearer logging.

**Main Themes and Innovations:**

1.  **Enhanced Stability and Error Handling:** A significant effort has been made to centralize and improve error reporting. Instead of `console.error`, a new `logger` utility is used consistently, providing more context and potentially styled output. Unhandled promise rejections are now caught globally with a more informative message, leading to more graceful exits.
2.  **Resource Management (Memory):** The CLI now intelligently manages Node.js `max-old-space-size` to prevent out-of-memory errors. It checks current heap limits against available system memory and relaunches itself with increased memory if necessary, ensuring smoother operation for demanding tasks.
3.  **Authentication and Configuration Robustness:** Authentication validation has been strengthened, particularly for non-interactive modes and when entering a sandbox environment. There's also a fallback to `GEMINI_API_KEY` if no explicit authentication method is chosen, making it easier to use in headless environments.
4.  **Improved User Experience (UI/CLI):**
    *   The terminal window title is dynamically updated to reflect the current workspace, providing better context for the user.
    *   Input validation has been added to prevent problematic control characters, enhancing security.
    *   Warning messages for issues like missing themes are now more informative.
5.  **Code Refactoring and Modularity:** The `main` function has been refactored into smaller, more manageable, and logically grouped asynchronous functions (`handleSettingsInitialization`, `initializeCoreServices`, `prepareExecutionEnvironment`, `runInteractiveMode`, `runNonInteractiveMode`). This significantly improves readability, testability, and maintainability.
6.  **Tooling and Dependency Management:** Updates to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` indicate dependency updates. There's also a new `readFile.ts` alongside `read-file.ts`, suggesting a potential renaming or refactoring of file system tools.

**Significant New Features or Improvements:**

*   **Automatic Node.js Memory Configuration:** The CLI now automatically detects system memory and adjusts Node.js's `max-old-space-size` to prevent crashes due to insufficient memory. This is a crucial improvement for long-running or resource-intensive operations.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Introduction of a `logger` utility for consistent and potentially styled output, improving debugging and user feedback.
*   **Enhanced Input Validation:** Basic security measure to prevent command injection by rejecting control characters in user input.
*   **Dynamic Window Title:** Sets the terminal window title, improving user orientation.
*   **Explicit Non-Interactive Tool Disabling:** In non-YOLO approval mode, interactive tools like `shell`, `edit`, and `writeFile` are explicitly excluded to prevent hanging in automated scripts.
*   **TSV File Read Support:** The `readFile` functionality now supports reading TSV files.

**Notable Code Refactoring or Architectural Changes:**

*   **`gemini.tsx` Orchestration:** The `main` function in `gemini.tsx` has been heavily refactored into a clear sequence of initialization, environment preparation, and mode-specific execution (interactive vs. non-interactive).
*   **Import Grouping:** Imports in `gemini.tsx` are now logically grouped (Foundational, Local Module, Arcane Constants & Colors, Helper Spells), improving code organization.
*   **`logger.js` Integration:** `console.log`/`error` calls are being replaced with `logger.debug`/`error`/`warn`, indicating a move towards a more sophisticated logging infrastructure.
*   **Removal of Redundant Code/Comments:** Clean-up of implicit `console.error` calls and some outdated comments.

**Potential Impact or Value of the Changes:**

These changes collectively lead to a more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable CLI. Users will experience fewer crashes due to memory issues, clearer error messages, and better guidance. Developers will benefit from a more organized codebase, making it easier to understand, debug, and extend. The improved authentication and non-interactive mode handling will also be valuable for CI/CD pipelines and scripting.

**Summary of Changes:**
This fork primarily focuses on improving the stability, user experience, and internal processes of the CLI tool, particularly regarding authentication, model interaction, and development workflow.

**Main Themes:**

*   **Robustness and Reliability:** Significant efforts have been made to improve the handling of rate limiting (429 errors) for OAuth users, ensuring a more stable and less disruptive experience. This includes increasing retry attempts and adjusting the fallback mechanism threshold.
*   **User Experience Refinement:** Improvements target the authentication flow to prevent unnecessary prompts and ensure correct default model settings, leading to a smoother user interaction.
*   **Development Workflow Optimization:** A key change is the addition of `sync-upstream.sh` to `.gitignore`, streamlining development by preventing accidental commits of a script used for upstream synchronization.
*   **Codebase Synchronization:** Multiple large merges from the `upstream/main` branch indicate an ongoing effort to keep the fork aligned with the upstream repository, bringing in a significant amount of changes, including updates to documentation, UI components, core functionalities, and testing.

**Significant New Features or Improvements:**

*   **Improved OAuth Rate Limit Handling:** The retry mechanism for 429 errors in OAuth contexts has been substantially beefed up, increasing `maxAttempts` from 5 to 60 and the fallback threshold from 2 consecutive 429s to 50. This greatly enhances the tool's resilience in high-demand scenarios.
*   **Optimized Authentication Flow:** The authentication process now uses a `shouldRefreshAuth` state, triggering a re-authentication flow only when the authentication method genuinely changes, reducing redundant operations and improving performance.
*   **Corrected Default Model Setting:** The default Gemini Flash model has been corrected to `gemini-2.5-pro` for consistency and accuracy.

**Notable Code Refactoring or Architectural Changes:**

*   **Extensive Upstream Merges:** The presence of numerous large merge commits suggests that the fork is actively integrating changes from its upstream source. This brings in a wide array of updates across various modules, including UI components, core client logic, tool definitions, and telemetry. While not direct refactoring within the fork, these merges inherently introduce refactoring and architectural evolution from the upstream.
*   **`sync-upstream.sh` Ignored:** Adding `sync-upstream.sh` to `.gitignore` is a minor but impactful change for the development workflow, preventing this internal script from being tracked by version control.

**Potential Impact or Value of the Changes:**

*   **Enhanced Stability for Power Users:** The improved handling of rate limits directly benefits users who frequently interact with the API, especially in "YOLO mode," by preventing premature service interruptions.
*   **Smoother User Interaction:** The refined authentication flow and correct default model settings contribute to a more intuitive and less frustrating experience for all users.
*   **Streamlined Development:** Ignoring the `sync-upstream.sh` script simplifies the Git history and reduces potential merge conflicts for developers maintaining the fork.
*   **Up-to-date Functionality:** The frequent merges with the upstream ensure that the fork remains current with the latest features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements from the main project.

**Summary of Changes:**
The recent changes in this fork represent a significant architectural shift, moving away from a gRPC-based server implementation towards a simpler `stdin`/`stdout` communication model, likely within a Dockerized environment.

The initial set of commits (`[e1c991c1](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/commit/e1c991c1)` to `[9cda79c7](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/commit/9cda79c7)`) focused on building and stabilizing a gRPC server. This involved a multi-phase implementation, including project setup, core integration, tool execution and security, and production hardening. A large number of files were added to support this, including `.proto` definitions, server-side implementation (`GrpcServiceImpl`, `SessionManager`, various service managers for authentication, configuration, file operations, streaming, etc.), and comprehensive tests. The final commit in this series (`[9cda79c7](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/commit/9cda79c7)`) indicates that all 232 gRPC server tests were passing, suggesting a robust and feature-rich server.

However, the subsequent commits (`[138d809a](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/commit/138d809a)` and `[1a3d2567](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/commit/1a3d2567)`) completely reverse this direction. The gRPC server implementation, along with its extensive codebase, is entirely removed. This massive deletion (over 46,000 lines of code) signals a clear decision to deprecate or remove the gRPC approach. The final commit then adds documentation that details the rationale behind this change, comparing the now-removed gRPC architecture with the new `stdin`/`stdout` Docker approach. This new documentation outlines the simpler `stdin`/`stdout` communication, highlighting its strengths in simplicity, compatibility, and isolation, while also acknowledging the features (like structured communication, scalability, and built-in security) that the gRPC server offered.

**Main Themes:**
*   **Architectural Simplification:** A deliberate move from a complex, feature-rich gRPC server to a more straightforward `stdin`/`stdout` communication model.
*   **Re-evaluation of Communication Strategy:** A decision to prioritize simplicity, direct integration, and container-based isolation over a full-fledged network service.
*   **Documentation of Design Choices:** Comprehensive documentation explaining the trade-offs and use cases for both the old (gRPC) and new (`stdin`/`stdout`) approaches.

**Significant New Features or Improvements:**
*   There are no new features in terms of functionality added in the latest commits; rather, a major existing component (the gRPC server) has been removed.
*   The primary "improvement" is a conceptual simplification of the communication mechanism, which could lead to easier deployment and integration in certain scenarios.
*   New documentation provides a valuable comparison of communication strategies.

**Notable Code Refactoring or Architectural Changes:**
*   **Complete Removal of gRPC Server:** This is the most significant architectural change, eliminating an entire `packages/grpc-server` module and its dependencies.
*   **Shift to `stdin`/`stdout` Paradigm:** The project is now geared towards process-based communication rather than network-based RPC.

**Potential Impact or Value of the Changes:**
*   **Reduced Complexity:** The `stdin`/`stdout` approach is generally simpler to debug and deploy for scenarios where network services are not strictly necessary.
*   **Improved Isolation (Docker):** Leveraging Docker's native `stdin`/`stdout` capabilities can enhance sandboxing and resource management.
*   **Easier Integration for CLI-centric Workflows:** For users who primarily interact with the tool via a command-line interface, direct process communication might feel more natural and less prone to network-related issues.
*   **Loss of Advanced Features:** The project loses the structured communication, built-in authentication, concurrent session management, and scalability features that the gRPC server provided. This might limit its use in multi-user, distributed, or web application integration scenarios. The new documentation acknowledges these trade-offs.

*   refactor
*   documentation
*   architectural-change

**Summary of Changes:**
## Fork Analysis: Gemini CLI Chinese Localization and NPM Publication

This fork primarily focuses on **internationalization for Chinese users** and **streamlining the installation process by publishing to NPM**. The changes indicate an effort to make the Gemini CLI more accessible to a broader audience in China.

### Main Themes and Purposes:

1.  **Chinese Localization:** The most prominent theme is the comprehensive translation of the CLI's documentation and potentially some UI elements into simplified Chinese. This includes `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and various UI component files.
2.  **NPM Publication:** The fork aims to make the CLI easily installable via `npm install -g gemini-cli-chinese` and runnable via `npx gemini-cli-chinese`, indicating a shift towards a more standard Node.js package distribution model.

### Significant New Features or Improvements:

*   **Bilingual Documentation:** The addition of `README.zh-CN.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md`, and `GEMINI.zh-CN.md` provides official Chinese documentation, significantly improving the onboarding experience for Chinese speakers.
*   **NPM Package Distribution:** Publishing the CLI under a new NPM package name (`gemini-cli-chinese`) simplifies installation and execution, moving away from direct GitHub URL `npx` commands.
*   **UI String Localization (Partial):** Many UI component files show deletions and insertions, often with Chinese characters in the commit messages, suggesting an effort to translate in-app strings for better user experience.

### Notable Code Refactoring or Architectural Changes:

*   **Package Name Change:** `package.json` files for `cli` and `core` packages have been updated, likely reflecting the new NPM package name.
*   **Import Fixes (`fix-imports.js`):** The presence of `fix-imports.js` suggests potential adjustments to import paths or module resolution, possibly related to the new package structure or localization efforts.
*   **Removal of Uninstall Documentation:** The `Uninstall.md` reference is removed from `README.md`, which might imply that uninstallation is now standard via `npm uninstall`.

### Potential Impact or Value of the Changes:

*   **Increased User Adoption:** By providing Chinese documentation and a familiar NPM installation method, the fork significantly lowers the barrier to entry for Chinese developers, potentially leading to increased adoption and community engagement in the region.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Localized UI strings (if fully implemented) will make the CLI more intuitive and user-friendly for non-English speakers.
*   **Simplified Distribution:** NPM publication makes the CLI easier to discover, install, and manage for Node.js developers.

**Summary of Changes:**
This fork introduces **Nix Flake integration** for improved reproducibility and development environment management, alongside a **bug fix** related to environment variable parsing.

### Summary of Changes:

The main themes of these changes are **developer experience improvement** through better environment management and **robustness** by fixing a critical environment variable parsing issue.

1.  **Nix Flake Integration:**
    *   **New Feature:** The addition of `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` files introduces Nix Flakes to the project. This provides a declarative and reproducible way to define the development environment, dependencies, and potentially build processes.
    *   **Impact:** This significantly improves the onboarding experience for new developers, ensures consistent development environments across different machines, and makes builds more reliable by pinning exact dependency versions. It's a major step towards a more robust and reproducible development workflow.
    *   **Architectural Change:** This introduces Nix as a new toolchain for managing the project's environment.

2.  **Environment Variable Handling Fix:**
    *   **Bug Fix/Functionality Improvement:** The `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD` environment variable was not being correctly processed. Previously, it could lead to incorrect behavior where a custom `system.md` file path wasn't used or the system prompt override wasn't enabled as intended.
    *   **Code Refactoring:** The logic for checking the `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD` variable has been refined to correctly handle truthy values, including custom paths, and to ensure that `0` or `false` (case-insensitive) correctly disable the feature. A new `systemMdVarLower` variable was introduced to handle case-insensitive comparisons more cleanly.
    *   **Impact:** This ensures that the application behaves as expected when users try to enable or specify a custom system prompt markdown file via the environment variable, preventing unexpected behavior and configuration issues.
