# pycodetags

You've seen `# TODO:` comments? What if they could be used as an issue tracker?

What if `# TODO:` style comments could serialize and deserialize records, turning comments into a database?

What if you could also write comments as decorators that warn or stop you on the due date?

Replace or complement your `# TODO:` comments with decorators similar to NotImplement, Deprecated or Warning
and get issue tracker features, too.

Lightweight and keeps your issue tracker in your code.

Backwards compatible with both `# TODO:` comments and PEP-350 comments.
