"""Core API for microlens-submit.

This module provides the core data models and API for managing microlensing
challenge submissions. The main classes are:

- :class:`Submission`: Top-level container for a submission project
- :class:`Event`: Container for solutions to a single microlensing event  
- :class:`Solution`: Individual model fit with parameters and metadata

The :class:`Submission` class provides methods for validation, export, and
persistence. The :func:`load` function is the main entry point for loading
or creating submission projects.

Example:
    >>> from microlens_submit import load
    >>> 
    >>> # Load or create a submission project
    >>> submission = load("./my_project")
    >>> 
    >>> # Set submission metadata
    >>> submission.team_name = "Team Alpha"
    >>> submission.tier = "advanced"
    >>> submission.repo_url = "https://github.com/team/repo"
    >>> 
    >>> # Add an event and solution
    >>> event = submission.get_event("EVENT001")
    >>> solution = event.add_solution("1S1L", {"t0": 2459123.5, "u0": 0.1, "tE": 20.0})
    >>> solution.log_likelihood = -1234.56
    >>> solution.set_compute_info(cpu_hours=2.5, wall_time_hours=0.5)
    >>> 
    >>> # Save the submission
    >>> submission.save()
    >>> 
    >>> # Export for submission
    >>> submission.export("submission.zip")

    """Container for an individual microlensing model fit.

    This data model stores everything required to describe a single
    microlensing solution, including the numeric parameters of the fit and
    metadata about how it was produced. Instances are normally created via
    :meth:`Event.add_solution` and persisted to disk when
    :meth:`Submission.save` is called.

    Attributes:
        solution_id: Unique identifier for the solution (auto-generated UUID).
        model_type: Specific lens/source configuration such as "1S1L" or "1S2L".
        bands: List of photometric bands used in the fit (e.g., ["0", "1", "2"]).
        higher_order_effects: List of physical effects modeled (e.g., ["parallax"]).
        t_ref: Reference time for time-dependent effects (Julian Date).
        parameters: Dictionary of model parameters used for the fit.
        is_active: Flag indicating whether the solution should be included in
            the final submission export.
        compute_info: Metadata about the computing environment, populated by
            :meth:`set_compute_info`.
        posterior_path: Optional path to a file containing posterior samples.
        lightcurve_plot_path: Optional path to the lightcurve plot file.
        lens_plane_plot_path: Optional path to the lens plane plot file.
        notes_path: Path to the markdown notes file for this solution.
        used_astrometry: Whether astrometric information was used when fitting.
        used_postage_stamps: Whether postage stamp data was used.
        limb_darkening_model: Name of the limb darkening model employed.
        limb_darkening_coeffs: Mapping of limb darkening coefficients.
        parameter_uncertainties: Uncertainties for parameters in parameters.
        physical_parameters: Physical parameters derived from the model.
        log_likelihood: Log-likelihood value of the fit.

    Note:
        The notes_path field supports Markdown formatting, allowing you to create rich,
        structured documentation with headers, lists, code blocks, tables, and links.
        This is particularly useful for creating detailed submission dossiers for evaluators.
        
        The run_validation() method performs comprehensive validation of parameters,
        higher-order effects, and physical consistency. Always validate solutions
        before submission.
