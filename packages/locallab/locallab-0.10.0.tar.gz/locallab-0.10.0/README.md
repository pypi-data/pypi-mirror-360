## 🧠 How LocalLab Works

LocalLab has three main components:

### 1. 🖥️ **LocalLab Server** (`pip install locallab`)
- Runs AI models on your computer
- Provides a web API for interactions
- Handles model loading and optimization
- Start with: `locallab start`

### 2. 💬 **Chat Interface** (Built-in)
- Terminal-based ChatGPT-like experience
- Real-time streaming responses
- Multiple generation modes
- Access with: `locallab chat`

### 3. 🐍 **Python Client** (`pip install locallab-client`)
- Programmatic access for your code
- Both sync and async support
- Use with: `client = SyncLocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")`

```

**🌟 The Magic**: Use `--use-ngrok` to access your AI from anywhere - your phone, another computer, or share with friends!

### 🎯 Key Features

```
📦 Easy Setup         🔒 Privacy First       🎮 Free GPU Access
🤖 Multiple Models    💾 Memory Efficient    🔄 Auto-Optimization
🌐 Local or Colab    ⚡ Fast Response       🔧 Simple Server
🌍 Access Anywhere   🔌 Client Package      🛡️ Secure Tunneling
```

**Two-Part System**:

- **LocalLab Server**: Runs the AI models and exposes API endpoints

       └── 🤖 AI Model
           └── 🔧 Auto-optimization
   ```

2. **On Google Colab (Free GPU Mode)**
   ```
   ☁️ Google Colab
   └── 🎮 Free GPU
       └── 🚀 LocalLab Server
           └── 🤖 AI Model
               └── ⚡ GPU Acceleration

🚀 LocalLab Chat Interface
✅ Connected to: http://localhost:8000
📊 Server: LocalLab v0.9.0 | Model: qwen-0.5b

You: Hello! Can you help me with Python?

AI: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with Python programming.
What specific topic would you like to explore?

You: Show me how to create a class --stream

AI: Here's how to create a simple class in Python:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old."

# Usage
person = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person.introduce())

You: /save
💾 Conversation saved to: chat_2024-07-06_14-30-15.json

You: /exit
👋 Goodbye!
```

### 🌐 Remote Access

Connect to any LocalLab server from anywhere:

```bash
# Connect to remote server
locallab chat --url https://abc123.ngrok.app

# Use with Google Colab
locallab chat --url https://your-colab-ngrok-url.app
```

> 📖 **Complete Guide**: See the [Chat Interface Documentation](./docs/cli/chat.md) for advanced features, examples, and troubleshooting.

## 🐍 Python Client - Programmatic Access

For developers who want to integrate AI into their applications, LocalLab provides a powerful Python client package.

### 🎯 Two Ways to Use LocalLab

| Method | Best For | Getting Started |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Chat Interface** | Interactive use, testing, quick questions | `locallab chat` |
| **Python Client** | Applications, scripts, automation | `from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient` |

### 📦 Synchronous Client (Recommended for Beginners)

```python
from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient

# Connect to server - choose ONE of these options:
# 1. For local server (default)
client = SyncLocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")

# 2. For remote server via ngrok (when using Google Colab or --use-ngrok)
# client = SyncLocalLabClient("https://abc123.ngrok.app")  # Replace with your ngrok URL

try:
    print("Generating text...")
    # Generate text
    response = client.generate("Write a story")
    print(response)

    print("Streaming responses...")
    # Stream responses
    for token in client.stream_generate("Tell me a story"):
       print(token, end="", flush=True)

    print("Chat responses...")
    # Chat with AI
    response = client.chat([
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ])
    print(response.choices[0]["message"]["content"])

finally:
    # Always close the client
    client.close()
```

> 💡 **Important**: When connecting to a server running on Google Colab or with ngrok enabled, always use the ngrok URL (https://abc123.ngrok.app) that was displayed when you started the server.

### Asynchronous Client Usage (For Advanced Users)

```python
import asyncio
from locallab_client import LocalLabClient

async def main():
    # Connect to server - choose ONE of these options:
    # 1. For local server (default)
    client = LocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")

    # 2. For remote server via ngrok (when using Google Colab or --use-ngrok)
    # client = LocalLabClient("https://abc123.ngrok.app")  # Replace with your ngrok URL

    try:
        print("Generating text...")
        # Generate text
        response = await client.generate("Write a story")
        print(response)

        print("Streaming responses...")
        # Stream responses
        async for token in client.stream_generate("Tell me a story"):
            print(token, end="", flush=True)

        print("\nChatting with AI...")
        # Chat with AI
        response = await client.chat([
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
        ])
        # Extracting Content
        content = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
        print(content)
    finally:
        # Always close the client
        await client.close()

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🌐 Google Colab Usage with Remote Access

### Step 1: Set Up the Server on Google Colab

First, you'll set up the LocalLab server on Google Colab to use their free GPU:

```python
# In your Colab notebook:

# 1. Install the server package
!pip install locallab

# 2. Configure with CLI (notice the ! prefix)
!locallab config

# 3. Start server with ngrok for remote access
!locallab start --use-ngrok

# The server will display a public URL like:
# 🚀 Ngrok Public URL: https://abc123.ngrok.app
# COPY THIS URL - you'll need it to connect!
```

### Step 2: Connect to Your Server

After setting up your server on Google Colab, you'll need to connect to it using the LocalLab client package. The server will display a ngrok URL that you'll use for the connection.

#### Using the Client Connection Examples

**You can now use the client connection examples from the [Client Connection & Usage](#-client-connection--usage) section above.**

Just make sure to:

1. Use your ngrok URL instead of localhost
2. Install the client package if needed

For example:

```python
# In another cell in the same Colab notebook:

# 1. Install the client package
!pip install locallab-client

# 2. Import the client
from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient

# 3. Connect to your ngrok URL (replace with your actual URL from Step 1)
client = SyncLocalLabClient("https://abc123.ngrok.app")  # ← REPLACE THIS with your URL!

# 4. Now you can use any of the client methods
response = client.generate("Write a poem about AI")
print(response)

# 5. Always close when done
client.close()
```

#### Access From Any Device

The power of using ngrok is that you can connect to your Colab server from anywhere:

```python
# On your local computer, phone, or any device with Python:
pip install locallab-client

from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient
client = SyncLocalLabClient("https://abc123.ngrok.app")  # ← REPLACE THIS with your URL!
response = client.generate("Hello from my device!")
print(response)
client.close()
```

> 💡 **Remote Access Tip**: The ngrok URL lets you access your LocalLab server from any device - your phone, tablet, another computer, or share with teammates. See the [Client Connection & Usage](#-client-connection--usage) section above for more examples of what you can do with the client.
