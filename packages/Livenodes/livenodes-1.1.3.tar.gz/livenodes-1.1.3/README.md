# Livenodes

Livenodes are small units of computation for digital signal processing in python. They are connected multiple synced channels to create complex graphs for real-time applications. Each node may provide a GUI or Graph for live interaction and visualization.

LN-Studio is a GUI Application to create, run and debug these graphs based on QT5.

Any contribution is welcome! These projects take more time, than I can muster, so feel free to create issues for everything that you think might work better and feel free to create a MR for them as well!

Have fun and good coding!

# Installation

```
pip install Livenodes
```


# Performance 
To disable assertion checks for types etc use
```
PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 lns
```

# Testing

1. `pip install -r requirements_setup.txt`
2. `tox -e py311` or `tox -e py312`
