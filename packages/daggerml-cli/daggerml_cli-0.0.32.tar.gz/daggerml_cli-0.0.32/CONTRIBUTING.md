## How to contribute to DaggerML

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/daggerml/daggerml-cli/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/daggerml/daggerml-cli/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Want to dive in?**

1. Find an issue you'd like to tackle from GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/daggerml/daggerml-cli/issues)
2. Check out the *Assignees* section on the issue tracker page. If nobody is already assigned, feel free to assign yourself. Otherwise message the assignee first to coordinate.
3. Click the "create a branch" link from within the issue tracker to create a branch for this particular issue.
4. Commit and push changes to that issue branch.
5. Once your code is ready to go, rebase off of master and create a pull request and set @amniskin as the approver. DO NOT MERGE TO MASTER.
