    "At its core, the transformer is a stack of $L$ transformer blocks that takes a length $N$ sequence of input tokens $\\{\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}^{(0)}_N\\}$ and outputs a length $N$ sequence of output tokens $\\{\\mathbf{x}^{(L)}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}^{(L)}_N\\}$. Each token $\\mathbf{x}^{(l)}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ is a vector of dimension $D$. \n",

    "![A vanilla Transformer Block consisting of 4 main operations: [**(multi-headed) attention**]{.red}, [**MLP**]{.blue}, [**(pre-)layernorms**]{.green}, and [**residual connections**]{.yellow}. The Transformer is a stack of these blocks, which we show depicted as a \"residual highway\" design. The residual highway showcases how each block \"perturbs\" its input, and the mathematical operation looks like a dynamical system. If the system can be described such that the operation of each block is a gradient descent, the system becomes an energy-based model.](./assets/figs/standard-transformer.png){#fig-standard-transformer}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Associative Memory** (AM) requires a global energy function, where each computation minimizes the total energy of the system. Our goal is to derive an energy function whose gradient looks as much like the Transformer block as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Energy Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now build a kind of associative memory called the \"Energy Transformer\" [@hoover2024energy] that turns the familiar transformer operation into an energy minimization. Energy Transformer (ET) defines a single energy on an $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}$ collection of tokens, where we can think of each token $\\mathbf{x}_B$ as a \"particle\" that knows some information about itself and needs to figure out what it should become. Some particles (unmasked tokens) already know their identity, while others (masked tokens) only know their position and must discover their identity by interacting with their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing the energy of the Energy Transformer (ET) is a recurrent process. The entire transformer consists of a single Transformer block, and each \"layer\" of the transformer becomes a gradient descent step down the energy. This gradient descent step looks remarkably like a standard transformer block, complete with attention, MLP-like operations, layer normalizations, and residual connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global energy combines two intuitive ideas: (1) **attention energy** that encourages masked tokens to align with relevant unmasked tokens, and (2) **memory energy** that ensures all tokens look like realistic patterns the model has learned. The gradient of each of these energies look like a self-attention and MLP, respectively, with some shared weight constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of those situations where the code ends up being significantly simpler than the equations. We write the equations for completeness, but feel free to skip to [@sec-ET-implementation] for succinct code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe the energy of a multi-headed attention with $H$ heads, where the $h$-th head of attention is parameterized by $\\mathbf{W}_h^Q, \\mathbf{W}_h^K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times Y}$, where $Y$ is the \"head dimension\". The input to the attention is the normalized token vectors $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}$. In the math that follows, we index the heads by $h=1\\ldots H$, the head dimension by $\\alpha=1\\ldots Y$, tokens by $A,B,C=1 \\ldots N$, and each token vector by $i,j=1\\ldots D$.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "## Einstein notation\n",
    "We find it convenient to use Einstein notation for the math, since it maps 1:1 to the einops operations we'll use in the code. If you aren't familiar with the notation, check out [this awesome tutorial](https://einops.rocks/1-einops-basics/). But fair warning, the equations at first look pretty complicated with all the indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "One tip for reading equations with lots of indices: *you don't need to remember the shape or order of tensors*, just remember the meaning of the indices. The number of subscripts is the number of dimensions of the tensor, and the meaning of each dimension is captured in the index name. For example, let $B=1\\ldots N$ index the token position in a sequence, and let $i=1\\ldots D$ index into each token vector. $x_{Bi}$ is an element of a 2-dimensional tensor capturing the sequence length $N$ and token dimension $D$. Transposes don't have meaning since things are named, so $x_{Bi} = x_{iB}$. So long as you know the index semantics, you can read always read the equation. Everything is just scalar multiplication and addition.\n",
