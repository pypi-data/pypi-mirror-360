# yv-languages

## Requirements

This project recommends Python 3.11 or higher.

## Installation

You need to connect to our private PyPi packages to install this library.
See how in our API Getting Started docs.

Then:

```bash
pip install yv-languages
```

Or if you are working in a microservice with Maker setup,
add `yv-languages` to your `requirements.in` file and run:

```bash
make deps-compile && make deps-install
```

## Usage

You can validate & make any language tag string canonical like:

```python
import yv_languages

bcp = yv_languages.canonical("eng")

print(str(bcp))  # "en"
```

## Development

This project was written and tested with Python 3.11.

We recommend using pyenv & pyenv-virtualenv which you can find instructions on installing
in our Getting Started documentation.

setup the project env
``` bash
make venv
```

create a .envrc file using this sample
``` bash
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
```

### Running tests

``` bash
make test
```

### Before committing any code

We have a pre-commit hook which should be setup.
You can symlink it to run before each commit by changing directory to the repo and running

``` bash
make githooks
```
