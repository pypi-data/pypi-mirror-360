    "Throughout, we consider settings in which potentially multi-product firms, indexed by $f$ compete across markets, indexed by $t$. In each market, there are $J_t$ products offered. Each firm $f$ offers a distinct subset of those products, $\\mathcal{J}_{ft}$. We use the $jt$ index to denote observations at the product-market level, and we use the $t$ index to denote the vector which stacks all $J_t$ observations in market $t$. Demand for product $j$ in market $t$, which depends on $p_t$, the price of all products in the market, is denoted $s_{jt}(p_t)$. Realizations of market shares across products in market $t$ at the equilibrium prices $p_t$ are denoted $s_t$. We denote the $J_t \\times J_t$ matrix of own- and cross-price derivatives as $\\frac{\\partial s_t}{\\partial p_t}$, so that the $(j,k)$-th element denotes the marginal effect of an increase in the price of product $k$ on the market share of product $j$.\n",

Thus, given equilibrium outcomes, the known market structure (i.e., which firm sells which products), and the demand system, $\\Delta_{mt}$ can be computed. $c_{mt}$ are the marginal costs implied by the model which satisfy the system of first order conditions.\n",
