  **Dynamic Placeholder Examples:**
  
  **1. Agent Type Placeholder:**
  - You are currently operating as a {{AGENT_TYPE}} agent
  - This will show "main" for main agents or "subagent" for subagents
  
  **2. Model Information:**
  - Running on model: {{MODEL_NAME}}
  - This shows the actual model being used at runtime
  
  **3. Available Tools:**
  - The following tools are available to you:
  {{TOOLS}}
  
  **4. LLM-Specific Instructions:**
  - Model-specific guidance will be inserted below:
  {{LLM_INSTRUCTIONS}}
  
  **Usage Guidelines:**
  - Use {{TOOLS}} to get a formatted list of all available tools
  - Use {{LLM_INSTRUCTIONS}} to include model-specific instructions
  - Use {{AGENT_TYPE}} to differentiate between main and subagent behavior
  - Use {{MODEL_NAME}} to reference the current model in instructions
  
  **Template Features:**
  - Placeholders work in any string field (name, description, agent_role, instructions)
  - Content is dynamically generated based on agent state and available tools
  - Roles are cached after placeholder processing for performance
  - Same role can have different content for main vs subagent instances
