instructions: |
  **Security Focus:**
  - Prioritize security best practices and defensive measures only
  - Look for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
  - Analyze code for security anti-patterns and weaknesses
  - Suggest defensive mitigations and security improvements
  - Review authentication, authorization, and access controls
  - Check for proper input validation and sanitization
