# Example Dynamic Role - Tool Pattern Examples
# Demonstrates different ways to match tools

# Exact tool name matches
builtin:read_file
builtin:write_file

# Wildcard patterns
builtin:*file*
*search*

# Partial name matches (will match any tool containing these strings)
grep
bash
web

# MCP tool patterns
mcp__*

# Multiple variations
todo
task

# Note: Patterns are checked in order:
# 1. fnmatch against tool_key (e.g., "builtin:read_file")
# 2. fnmatch against tool_name (e.g., "read_file") 
# 3. substring match in tool_key
# 4. substring match in tool_name
