Elastic constitutive models cannot be defined by a Helmholtz free energy density but still depend on only the deformation gradient.
These constitutive models are therefore defined by a relation for some stress measure as a function of the deformation gradient.
Consequently, the tangent stiffness associated with the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress is not symmetric for these constitutive models.
