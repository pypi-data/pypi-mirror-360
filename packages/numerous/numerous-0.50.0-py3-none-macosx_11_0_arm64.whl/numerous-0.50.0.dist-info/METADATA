Welcome to the Numerous Developer Documentation page!

This is the documentation for the Numerous SDK. If you are looking an overview of the
Numerous platform, please visit the
[Numerous platform documentation](https://numerous.com/docs).

üì• To begin, install the SDK into your Python environment with:

    pip install numerous

üõ† The installation includes two main components: the CLI and the Numerous
Python package.

## Command Line Interface (CLI): A tool for managing your apps

Use the CLI to deploy and manage apps on the Numerous platform:

- `numerous init` - Create a new Numerous app
- `numerous deploy` - Deploy your app to production

## Python SDK package: Integrate Numerous features into Python-based web apps

The SDK enables you to interact with Numerous services programmatically in
your Python web applications.

- Store and organize data (JSON documents, and files) with collections.
- Access information about users and manage user interaction with sessions.

# SDK Development

This section contains information about how to develop the SDK itself for
developers interested in contributing to the SDK.

Most common tasks are defined in the `Makefile`. Use `make help` to get an
overview.

To setup pre-commit hooks, use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
to setup hooks for linters and tests. This requires pre-commit to be installed and it is included in the Python SDK development dependencies.

To install pre-commit and pre-push hooks:

    pre-commit install

And you can run them on demand:

    pre-commit run --all

## Development of Python SDK üêç

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    python -m venv ./venv
    ./venv/bin/activate

Install the package in editable mode (including development dependencies):

    pip install -e ./python[dev]

Run the tests:

    make sdk-test

And the linters:

    make sdk-lint

## Development of Go CLI üêπ

To build, run `make cli-build`. The executable is stored as `build/numerous`.

While developing, you can run the CLI like below:

    # Run the CLI
    go run .

    # e.g.
    go run . init
    go run . dev

You can lint with:

    make cli-lint

And you can run tests with:

    make cli-test
