    """
    Exports surface data to an OFF (Object File Format) file for visualization.

    This function creates an OFF file containing the geometric data of specified surfaces from a network.
    The surfaces can be colored either uniformly or based on curvature values (Gaussian or mean curvature)
    depending on the network settings. The output file contains vertex coordinates and triangle face
    definitions with optional color information.

    Args:
        net: Network object containing surface data and settings
        surfs: List of surface indices to export
        file_name: Base name for the output OFF file
        color: Optional color tuple (R,G,B) for uniform coloring. If False, uses network settings
        directory: Optional output directory path. If None, uses current directory

    Returns:
        None: Creates an OFF file with the specified surface data
