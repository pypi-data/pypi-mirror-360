# AWS Batch

## Dependencies

## The example

1. Read script
2. funkify the script with the python3.12 base image for batch (we don't have
   ecr yet, so this is the best we can do).
3. run that image on aws batch

## Notes

- We don't need any custom images -- we just need to pip install daggerml and
  daggerml-cli
