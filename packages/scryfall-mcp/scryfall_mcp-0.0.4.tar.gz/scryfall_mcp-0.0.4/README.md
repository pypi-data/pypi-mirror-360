A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to the Scryfall API for Magic: The Gathering card data. This server enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to search for cards, retrieve card information, download high-resolution images, and access comprehensive MTG data through a standardized interface.

## Features

- **Card Search**: Search for Magic: The Gathering cards using Scryfall's powerful search syntax
- **Card Details**: Retrieve detailed information about specific cards including prices, legality, and metadata
- **Image Downloads**: Download high-resolution card images and art crops with automatic organization
- **Database Operations**: Manage local card databases with integrity verification and cleanup tools
- **Set Information**: Access information about MTG sets and expansions
- **Artwork Access**: Get high-quality card artwork and images in multiple formats
- **Advanced Filtering**: Use Scryfall's advanced search operators for precise queries
- **Version Management**: Support for downloading specific card versions by set and collector number
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to respect Scryfall API guidelines

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install scryfall-mcp
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaminaduck/scryfall-mcp.git
cd scryfall-mcp
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Running the Server

Start the MCP server:

```bash
python -m scryfall_mcp
```

Or run directly:

```python
from scryfall_mcp import main
main()
```

### Basic Usage

The server provides several tools that can be used by MCP clients:

#### Search for Cards

```python
# Search for Lightning Bolt cards
result = mcp_search_cards("lightning bolt")

# Search for red creatures with converted mana cost 3
result = mcp_search_cards("t:creature c:red cmc:3")

# Search for cards in a specific set
result = mcp_search_cards("set:znr")
```

#### Download Card Images

```python
# Download a specific card image
result = mcp_download_card("Lightning Bolt")

# Download from a specific set
result = mcp_download_card("Lightning Bolt", set_code="m10", collector_number="146")

# Force re-download
result = mcp_download_card("Lightning Bolt", force_download=True)
```

#### Download Art Crops

```python
# Download art crop for a card
result = mcp_download_art_crop("Lightning Bolt")

# Download art crop from specific printing
result = mcp_download_art_crop("Lightning Bolt", set_code="m10", collector_number="146")
```
