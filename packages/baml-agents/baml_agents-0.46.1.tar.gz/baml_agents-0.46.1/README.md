**Building Agents with LLM structured generation ([BAML](https://www.boundaryml.com/)), [MCP Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools), and [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) principles**

This repository shares useful patterns I use when working with BAML. Note: The API may unexpectedly change with future minor versions; therefore, install with specific version constraints:

```bash
pip install "baml-agents>=0.46.1,<0.47.0"
```

## Repository Structure

*   `/notebooks`: **Core Tutorials & Examples.** Contains curated Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key features and recommended patterns. Start here to learn `baml-agents`.
*   `/explorations`: **Experimental & Niche Content.** Holds prototypes, tests, and examples for specific or advanced use cases. Content may be less polished or stable. See the [explorations README](./explorations/README.md).
*   `/baml_agents/devtools`: **Developer Utilities.** Contains helper scripts for project maintenance, development workflows, and automating tasks (e.g., updating baml generator versions). See the [devtools README](./baml_agents/devtools/README.md).

## Contents (Core Tutorials)

The primary tutorials are located in the `/notebooks` directory:

1.  [Flexible LLM Client Management in BAML](notebooks/01_baml_llm_client_config.ipynb)
    - Effortlessly switch between different LLM providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) at runtime using simple helper functions.
    - Bridge compatibility gaps: Connect to unsupported LLM backends or tracing systems (e.g., Langfuse, LangSmith) via standard proxy setups.
    - Solve common configuration issues: Learn alternatives for managing API keys and client settings if environment variables aren't suitable.
2.  [Introduction to AI Tool Use with BAML](notebooks/02_baml_custom_tools.ipynb)
    - Learn how to define custom actions (tools) for your AI using Pydantic models, making your agents capable of _doing_ things.
    - See how to integrate these tools with BAML manually or dynamically using `ActionRunner` for flexible structured outputs.
    - Understand how BAML translates goals into structured LLM calls that select and utilize the appropriate tool.
3.  [Integrating Standardized MCP Tools with BAML](notebooks/03_baml_with_mcp_tools.ipynb)
    - Discover how to leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to easily plug-and-play pre-built 3rd party tools (like calculators, web search) into your BAML agents.
    - See `ActionRunner` in action, automatically discovering and integrating tools from MCP servers with minimal configuration.
    - Learn techniques to filter and select specific MCP tools to offer to the LLM, controlling the agent's capabilities precisely.
4.  [Interactive BAML Development in Jupyter](notebooks/04_interactive_baml_jupyter.ipynb)
    - See BAML's structured data generation stream _live_ into your Jupyter output cell as the LLM generates it.
    - Interactively inspect the details: Use collapsible sections to view full LLM prompts and responses, optionally grouped by call or session, directly in the notebook.
    - Chat with your agent: Interactive chat widget right in the notebook, allowing you to chat with your agent in real-time.
5.  [Simple Agent Demonstration](notebooks/05_simple_agent_demo.ipynb)
    - Putting it all together: Build a simple, functional agent capable of tackling a multi-step task.
    - Learn how to combine custom Python actions (defined as `Action` classes) with standardized MCP tools (like calculators or time servers) managed by `ActionRunner`.
    - Follow the agent's decision-making loop driven by BAML's structured output generation (`GetNextAction`), see it execute tools, and observe how it uses the results to progress.
    - Includes demonstration of `JupyterBamlMonitor` for transparent inspection of the underlying LLM interactions.

## Simple example

> [!TIP]
> The code below is trimmed for brevity to **illustrate the core concepts**. Some function names or setup steps may differ slightly from the full notebook implementation for clarity in this example. The full, runnable code is available in the notebook <a href="notebooks/05_simple_agent_demo.ipynb">Simple Agent Demonstration (notebooks/05_simple_agent_demo.ipynb)</a>

  <summary>Show code for the example below</summary>

```python
def get_weather_info(city: str):
    return f"The weather in {city} is 63 degrees fahrenheit with cloudy conditions."

def stop_execution(final_answer: str):
    return f"Final answer: {final_answer}"

r = ActionRunner() # Doing an action means using a tool

# Adding a tool to allow the agent to do math
r.add_from_mcp_server(server="uvx mcp-server-calculator")

# Adding a tool to get the current time
r.add_from_mcp_server(server="uvx mcp-timeserver")  # Note: you can also add URLs

# Adding a tool to get the current weather
r.add_action(get_weather_info)

# Adding a tool to let the agent stop execution
r.add_action(stop_execution)

async def execute_task(llm, task: str) -> str:
    interactions = []
    while True:
        action = await llm.GetNextAction(task, interactions)
        if result := is_result_available(action):
            return result

        result = r.run(action)
        interactions.append(new_interaction(action, result))

llm = LLMClient("gpt-4.1-nano")
task = r.execute_task(llm, "State the current date along with avg temp between LA, NY, and Chicago in Fahrenheit.")
```

## But how does it work in detail?

#### Part 1
- It all starts with the Typebuilder: https://docs.boundaryml.com/ref/baml_client/type-builder
- we create a baml function output type
```
class NextAction {
    @@dynamic
}
```
- We'll use the typebuilder to make it during runtime into a
```
class NextAction {
    chosen_action MyTool1 | MyTool2 | MyTool3
}
```
- this happens right here with the add_property

pseudocode:
```
NextAction.add_property("chosen_action", MyTool1 | MyTool2 | MyTool3)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3077f67f-5e57-4e59-bbc3-69a66c310863)

#### Part 2
- "ActionRunner" is basically a container which registers the tools
```
r = ActionRunner(TypeBuilder)
r.add_action(MyTool1)
r.add_action(MyTool2)
r.add_action(MyTool3)
```
or just 
```
r.add_from_mcp_server(calculator_mcp)
```
to bulk-add all tools from some mcp server 
- Then, r.tb just creates the typebuilder from Part1.
according to baml docs, passing the typebuilder makes the baml modify the output classes according to the passed typebuilder
in our case it adds the one field as described in part1
```
tb = r.tb(T.BamlCustomTools_NextAction)
action = b.BamlCustomTools_GetNextAction(
    question, baml_options={"tb": tb}
)
```
- returned variable action just contains the tool name and all arguments, for example `MyTool1` and `{"name": "John"}`
- therefore tool_output = r.run(action) is just a convenience method which just does `tool_output = MyTool1(name="John")`

## Running the Notebooks

To run code from the `notebooks/` folder, you'll first need to:

- Install the [`uv` python package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- Install all dependencies: `uv sync --dev`
- Generate necessary BAML code: `uv run baml-cli generate`
  - Alternatively, you can use the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boundary.baml-extension) to do it automatically every time you edit a `.baml` file.
