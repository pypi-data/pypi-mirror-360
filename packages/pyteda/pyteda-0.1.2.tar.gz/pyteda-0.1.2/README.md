## Introducing TEDA: The Premier Python Toolbox for Teaching Ensemble-based Data Assimilation

![Class Diagram](imgs/Class_TEDA.svg)

We are thrilled to present TEDA, a cutting-edge Python toolbox designed to facilitate the teaching and learning of ensemble-based data assimilation (DA). TEDA caters to the needs of educators and learners alike, offering a comprehensive platform to explore the captivating world of meteorological anomalies, climate change, and DA methodologies.

TEDA stands out as an exceptional resource in the landscape of DA software, as it prioritizes the educational experience. While operational software tends to focus on practical applications, TEDA empowers undergraduate and graduate students by providing an intuitive platform to grasp the intricacies of ensemble-based DA concepts and foster enthusiasm for scientific exploration.

Equipped with a diverse range of features and functionalities, TEDA enriches the learning process by offering powerful visualization tools. Students can delve into error statistics, model errors, observational errors, error distributions, and the dynamic evolution of errors. These visualizations provide multiple perspectives on numerical results, enabling students to develop a deep understanding of ensemble-based DA principles.

TEDA offers numerous ensemble-based DA methods, allowing students to explore an extensive range of techniques. From the stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to dual EnKF formulations, EnKF via Cholesky decomposition, EnKF based on modified Cholesky decomposition, EnKF based on B-localization, and beyond, TEDA equips learners with a comprehensive toolkit to study and compare various DA methodologies.

TEDA's foundation is rooted in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, enabling effortless integration of new techniques and models. This ensures that TEDA remains at the forefront of the rapidly evolving field of ensemble-based DA, allowing educators and researchers to incorporate the latest advancements into their teaching and experimentation.

Embark on a captivating journey of discovery and knowledge with TEDA as it unveils the secrets of data assimilation. Simulate various DA scenarios, experiment with different model configurations, and witness firsthand the transformative impact of ensemble-based DA methods on forecast accuracy and data analysis.

Unlock your true potential in the realm of data assimilation with TEDA. Whether you are an enthusiastic student or a dedicated educator, TEDA stands as your ultimate companion in unraveling the complexities of ensemble-based DA.

### üß™ Toy Models for Data Assimilation

To enhance the learning experience, **TEDA** is built around **toy models** that exhibit chaotic behavior under specific configurations. These models are ideal for experimenting with and validating various Data Assimilation (DA) techniques in a hands-on, controlled setting.

Currently, TEDA includes the **Lorenz 96 model** (40 variables), a well-known benchmark in DA research.

> üìå *Support for other classic chaotic systems like the Duffing equation and Lorenz 63 may be added in future versions.*



## How easy is to use it?

Choose the desired method from the pool of available methods:

```python
from analysis.analysis_enkf_modified_cholesky import AnalysisEnKFModifiedCholesky
```

Select a model to perform the simulations:

```python
model = Lorenz96()
```

Create a background object with the desired parameters:

```python
background = Background(model, ensemble_size=20)
```

Create an analysis object with the desired method and its parameters + the chosen model:

```python
analysis = AnalysisEnKFModifiedCholesky(model, r=2)
```

Define the observation parameters:

```python
observation = Observation(m=32, std_obs=0.01)
```

Set up the parameters for the simulation:

```python
params = {'obs_freq': 0.1, 'obs_times': 10, 'inf_fact': 1.04}

simulation = Simulation(
    model,
    background,
    analysis,
    observation,
    params=params,
    log_level=None  # set to None to disable logging
)
```

and then, run the simulation!

```python
simulation.run()
```


### ‚ú® Logging (Optional)

> üí° **Note:** If you want to enable logs (e.g., for debugging or monitoring), just pass a `log_level` when creating the simulation.
> To **disable logs**, use `log_level=None`.

```python
import logging

simulation = Simulation(
    model,
    background,
    analysis,
    observation,
    params=params,
    log_level=logging.INFO  # set to None to disable logging
)
```

You can then request the backgound and analysis errors per assimilation step for plotting purposes or statistical computations:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

errb, erra = simulation.get_errors()

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
plt.plot(np.log10(errb),'-ob')
plt.plot(np.log10(erra),'-or')
plt.show()
```

üìÅ Example usage

See [`examples/basic_template.py`](examples/basic_template.py) for a complete simulation workflow.

---

### üöÄ Installation and Quick Start

We recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Or, if you're developing TEDA locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the basic example

Once installed, you can run the full example with:

```bash
python -m examples.basic_template
```

This will initialize the Lorenz96 model, run an ensemble-based data assimilation simulation, and display the log-relative errors for both the background and analysis states.
