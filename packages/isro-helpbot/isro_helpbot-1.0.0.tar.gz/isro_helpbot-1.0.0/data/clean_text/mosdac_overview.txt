MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre) is an initiative by ISRO to make satellite-based data accessible to the public and scientific community.

The portal hosts a variety of data products including cloud coverage, temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind patterns, and ocean parameters. It also includes FAQs, documentation, and satellite mission details.

The data is critical for researchers, policy makers, and weather monitoring agencies.
