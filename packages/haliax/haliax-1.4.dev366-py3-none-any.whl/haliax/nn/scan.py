class Stacked(ModuleWithStateDictSerialization, Generic[M]):
    """
    A "Stacked" wraps another module and produces a "stacked" version of it, where an input is applied
    to each instance of the stacked module in sequence. This is useful for e.g. transformers
    where you have multiple instances of the same transformer block and the input is applied in a fold/for loop
    in sequence.

    It's similar in spirit to an [equinox.nn.Sequential], but it must be homogeneous. In Jax, this is much cheaper to
    compile than a sequential (or moral equivalent), because Jax compiles the module's method once, instead of unrolling
    the sequential and compiling everything as a giant graph. In Jax, this pattern is often called "scan layers" or
    "scan over layers".

    A further constraint is that the elements of the stack must have the same Python control flow. This is because
    Jax's scan primitive requires that the function you pass to it is pure, and the only way to do that is to ensure
    that the function has the same control flow for every element of the stack.

    Stacked supports both "fold" and "scan" semantics. "fold" is the same as a for loop that accumulates a single
    output, while "scan" is the same as a for loop that accumulates a list of outputs as well as the final output.

    Stacked also supports gradient checkpointing, which is useful for very large models that don't fit in memory.

    Typically only one of "fold" or "scan" can be used with a given Stacked module, depending on the what the module
    returns: if the module returns a single output, use "fold"; if the module returns a sequence of outputs and
    an output to be passed to the next layer, use "scan". More concretely, for a transformer, you would use "scan" if
    you wanted to return a kv cache (or the attention matrix) as well as the output of the transformer. If you just
    wanted the output of the transformer, you would use "fold".


    Example:
        ```python
        >>> import equinox as eqx
        >>> import haliax as hax
        >>> import haliax.nn as hnn
        >>> class MyModule(eqx.Module):

        ...         self.layers = Stacked.init(self.axis, hnn.Linear)(In=hidden, Out=hidden, key=split_key)
        ...
        ...     def __call__(self, x):
        ...         return self.layers.fold(x)  # applies each layer in sequence
        ...

        >>> mod = MyModule(5, Hidden)
