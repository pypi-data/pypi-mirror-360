Asynchronous Python client for [Powerfox][poweropti] devices (poweropti's).

## About

A python package with which you can read the data from a [poweropti][poweropti]
device, via your Powerfox account (cloud polling). [Powerfox][powerfox] has various
poweropti devices on the market that you can use with a power, heat and water meter.

## Installation

```bash
pip install powerfox
```

## Poweropti devices

Not all Poweropti devices are supported currently. Check the list below to see if your
device is working with this package. Or help us by testing a device and let us know if
it works.

| Device                | Type        | Supported  |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| PA 201901 / PA 201902 | Power meter | Yes        |
| PB 202001             | Power meter | Yes        |
| WA 201902             | Water meter | Yes        |

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.
By clicking the button below you immediately start a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

### Installation

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

_Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages_.

### Pre-commit

This repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. To setup the pre-commit check, run:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

And to run all checks and tests manually, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

It uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the test framework. To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To update the [syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy) snapshot tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --snapshot-update
```
