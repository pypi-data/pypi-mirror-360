## 📝 Description

**WebWizard** is an automation tool that uses Selenium to perform various actions in the browser. Designed with flexibility in mind, WebWizard is driven by a YAML configuration, allowing users to navigate websites, interact with elements, capture screenshots, and much more.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate to any provided URL.
- **Interaction:** Fill fields, click on elements, scroll through pages, and simulate keyboard inputs.
- **Screenshot:** Capture the current web page with options to modify element styles before capturing.
- **Loops:** Introduce automation loops either through defined times, local files, or even URLs.
- **Configurable:** Easily customizable through a `config.yaml` file.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python Packages: `selenium`, `yaml`, `requests`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

WebWizard's heart lies in its `config.yaml` file. This configuration file allows you to define various actions (`start`) and some additional settings (`config`).

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 🧙 Python Basic Implementation
Single spell:
```
from pywebwizard import PyWebWizard

config_file = "example.yaml"
wizard = PyWebWizard(config_file)
wizard.invoke()
```

Multiple spells:
```
from pywebwizard import PyWebWizard

spell_book = [
  "example1.yaml",
  "example2.yaml",
  "example3.yaml",
]
wizard = PyWebWizard(spell_book)
wizard.invoke()
```

## 🧩 Web Elements: Interfaces

In WebWizard, interfaces play a crucial role in identifying and interacting with web elements. They provide a way to pinpoint specific elements on a web page. Here are the available interfaces with brief explanations and examples for each:

### 1. 🆔 `id`

The `id` interface targets elements based on their unique `id` attribute.

```
elements:
  name_field:
    interface: id
    query: name_id
```

### 2. 📝 Name

The `name` interface focuses on elements using their `name` attribute, often used in form fields.

```
elements:
  email_field:
    interface: name
    query: email_name
```

### 3. 🧭 `xpath`

The `xpath` interface allows for powerful and flexible navigation of the HTML structure.

```
elements:
  message_box:
    interface: xpath
    query: //div/textarea[@name="message"]
```

### 4. 🎨 `css`

The `css` interface uses CSS selectors to identify elements.

```
elements:
  submit_button:
    interface: css
    query: .submit-btn-class
```

### 5. 📚 `class`

The `class` interface locates elements based on their class attribute.

```
elements:
  notification:
    interface: class
    query: notification-class
```

### 6. 🏷️ `tag`

The `tag` interface finds elements based on their HTML tag name.

```
elements:
  all_images:
    interface: tag
    query: img
```

### 7. 🔗 `link_text`

The `link_text` interface targets anchor tags (`<a>`) using the exact text they display.

```
elements:
  signup_link:
    interface: link_text
    query: Sign Up Now!
```

### 8. 🔗 `link_text_partial`

The `link_text_partial` interface is similar to `link_text` but matches based on a part of the anchor tag's text.

```
elements:
  partial_link:
    interface: link_text_partial
    query: Sign
```

Each of these interfaces offers a different way to interact with web elements. The choice of interface largely depends on the specific requirements of your automation tasks and the structure of the web page you're working with.

## 🔄 Actions with Examples

Below are the actions available and a brief example for each:

- **Navigate:** Directs the browser to a specific URL.
```
- action: navigate
  url: https://example.com/
```
  
- **Loop:** Automate repetitive tasks using loops. You can loop a fixed number of times, or iterate over local/remote JSON files.
```
- action: loop
  times: 5
  do:
    - action: fill
      interface: id
      query: email
      content: example@email.com
```

- **Fill:** Populate fields on the webpage.
```
- action: fill
  <<: *name_field
  content: John Doe
```
  
- **Keyboard:** Simulate keyboard presses like 'tab', 'enter', etc. This action keys are the combination of keyboard keys. All keys added to this list are going to be pressed at the same time.
```
- action: keyboard
  keys:
    - "tab"
```
  
- **Scroll:** Scroll in the active website tab on the x or y axis. At least one of x or y value needs to be set.
```
- action: scroll
  x: 0
  y: 200
```
  
- **Execute JS:** Execute JavaScript commands in the browser.
```
- action: execute
  js: "$('#name').addClass('example')"
```
  
- **Wait for element:** Waits for an element to exist for a maximum amount of time. Default is 10 seconds.
```
- action: wait
  interface: id
  query: name
  timeout: 10
```
  
- **Screenshot:** Capture the webpage. You can also apply CSS before taking the screenshot, like in this example referencing an element by the interface and query and setting literally the style you give.
```
- action: screenshot
  file_name: capture
  css:
    - interface: id
      query: email_field
      style: "border: 3px solid blue;"
```

## 🔁 Loop Actions and Their Modes

The `loop` action in WebWizard allows users to automate repetitive tasks. There are three modes available for looping:

### 1. 🔁 `times`

Iterate a set of actions for a specified number of times. This is useful for performing a repetitive task without the need for external data.

```
- action: loop
  times: 5
  do:
    - action: fill
      interface: id
      query: email
      content: example@email.com
```

### 2. 📂 `source` (Local JSON File)

Use a local JSON file as a source for looping. Each entry in the JSON file can be used for each iteration. The `do__key` format allows you to pull data from the JSON's keys for each iteration.

```
- action: loop
  source: F:\PARENDUM\Software\autobrowser\data.json
  do:
    - action: fill
      interface: id
      query: name_field
      content: do__name
```

### 3. 🌐 `source` (URL)

Similar to the local JSON file mode, but this time the source is a remote URL which returns a JSON. The same `do__key` format applies here.

```
- action: loop
  source: http://example.com/data.json
  do:
    - action: fill
      interface: id
      query: name_field
      content: do__name
```

### 3. 🧾 `raw` (URL)

This raw could be a JSON string. The same `do__key` format applies here.

```
- action: loop
  raw: "{'name': 'Kevin'}"
  do:
    - action: fill
      interface: id
      query: name_field
      content: do__name
```

Using the `do__key` format, you can dynamically pull data from your JSON (whether local or from a URL) and use it in your actions. This provides a powerful way to automate tasks with varying data.

## ⏳ Timeout for Element Selection

In scenarios where WebWizard tries to interact with an element that may not be immediately available, a `timeout` feature is available to avoid abrupt errors or exceptions. By default, WebWizard will wait for up to 10 seconds for an element to become available before throwing an exception. This is particularly useful in situations where the webpage might take some time to load all its elements, especially in cases of heavy JavaScript usage or slow network speeds.

You can specify the `timeout` parameter alongside the `interface` and `query` in your element selection configuration. Here's how you can do it:

```
elements:
  dynamic_content:
    interface: id
    query: name
    timeout: 15  # Wait up to 15 seconds for the element
```

In the example above, WebWizard waits for up to 15 seconds for an element with the specified ID to appear. If the element doesn't become available within this time, an exception will be thrown, and you'll be informed of the timeout incident, allowing you to handle these cases gracefully in your automation script.

Remember, while the default wait time is 10 seconds, you can adjust the `timeout` to any number of seconds that suits your needs, depending on the expected behavior of the web pages you are interacting with.
