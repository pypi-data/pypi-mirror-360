        "Your workflow consists of the following steps:\n"
        "1. Accept a user-provided concept — this may be abstract, loosely defined, or stylistically expressive.\n"
        "2. Invoke the **style_agent_tool** to interpret the concept and generate a vivid, structured, and fashion-specific prompt.\n"
        "3. Pass the refined prompt to the **image_generation_tool** to produce a high-quality fashion image.\n"
        "4. Use the resulting image: `generated_image.png` to create a short, cinematic fashion video targeting a fashion-forward audience.\n\n"
        "5. Write an strong social media post that captures the essence of the fashion image and video, the historical inspiration,  designed to engage and inspire followers.\n\n"
        "Don't modify the enhanced prompt ; use them as-is for video generation.\n"
        "Ensure each step flows smoothly, the visual output is coherent and expressive, and the final result aligns with the user's creative intent."
