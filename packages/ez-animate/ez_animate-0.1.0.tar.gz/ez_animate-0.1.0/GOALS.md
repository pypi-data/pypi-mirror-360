# Project Goals: ez-animate

This document outlines the vision, scope, and target audience for the `ez-animate` Python package. It serves as a guiding star for development priorities, especially for the initial version (v0.1.0).

## 1. Project Name

*   **`ez-animate`**
*   *(Status: Name checked and available on PyPI)*

## 2. Core Purpose (The "Why")

`ez-animate` is a Python package that provides a high-level, declarative API to create common Matplotlib animations with minimal boilerplate code.

## 3. The Problem We're Solving

Creating animations directly with Matplotlib's `animation.FuncAnimation` is powerful but often verbose and unintuitive for common use cases. This package aims to solve the following pain points:

*   **Complex Setup:** Abstracting away the need for users to manually write `init` and `update` functions.
*   **State Management:** Simplifying the process of managing data and artist states between animation frames.
*   **Repetitive Code:** Reducing the amount of boilerplate required for standard animations, allowing users to focus on their data and the story they want to tell.

## 4. Target Audience (The "Who")

This package is designed for users who value simplicity and speed when creating standard visualizations.

#### Primary Audience:
*   **Data Scientists & Analysts:** Professionals who need to quickly generate animations for exploratory data analysis, presentations, or within Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

#### Secondary Audience:
*   **Students & Educators:** Individuals learning data visualization who want to create animations without getting bogged down in Matplotlib's low-level API.
*   **Researchers:** Academics who need to produce clear, reproducible animations for publications or talks without a steep learning curve.

## 5. Scope for the First Release (v0.1.0)

To ensure a focused and successful initial release, the scope will be strictly defined.

### In Scope for v0.1.0:

*   **A Central `Animator` Class:** A single, primary class that serves as the main entry point for creating animations.
*   **Simplified Data Handling:** The animator will accept a simple iterable (like a list or generator) where each item corresponds to the data for one frame.
*   **Core Animation Type:** The initial focus will be on a single, fundamental use case: animating a 2D line plot that updates over time.
*   **Basic Plot Customization:** Users should be able to pass in pre-configured Matplotlib `Figure` and `Axes` objects to control titles, labels, and styles.
*   **Standard Output:** The ability to create a `FuncAnimation` object that can be displayed in a notebook or saved to standard formats (e.g., `.gif`, `.mp4`) using Matplotlib's existing savers.
*   **Clear Documentation:** A `README.md` and a simple "Quickstart" guide demonstrating the core functionality.

### Out of Scope for v0.1.0 (Potential Future Features):

*   **Advanced Pre-built Animations:** No specialized, one-line functions for things like bar chart races, scatter plot evolution, or animated heatmaps in the first version.
*   **Interactive Controls:** No widgets or interactive elements for controlling the animation.
*   **Direct `pandas` Integration:** The package will not have special logic to parse `pandas` DataFrames directly. Users will be expected to provide data in a basic iterable format.
*   **3D Animations:** The initial release will focus exclusively on 2D plots.
*   **Performance Optimizations:** While the code will be clean, it will not initially be optimized for "blitting" or handling extremely large datasets. The focus is on API simplicity first.
