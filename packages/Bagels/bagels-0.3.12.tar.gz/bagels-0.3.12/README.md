Bagels expense tracker is a TUI application where you can track and analyse your money flow, with convenience oriented features and a complete interface.

> **Why an expense tracker in the terminal?**
> I found it easier to build a habit and keep an accurate track of my expenses if I do it at the end of the day, instead of on the go. So why not in the terminal where it's fast, and I can keep all my data locally?

## üì¶ Installation

<details open>
    <summary><b>Recommended: By UV</b></summary>

Bagels can be installed via uv on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

`uv` is a single Rust binary that you can use to install Python apps. It's significantly faster than alternative tools, and will get you up and running with Bagels in seconds.

You don't even need to worry about installing Python yourself - uv will manage everything for you.

#### Unix / MacOS:

```bash
# install uv (package manager):
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# restart your terminal, or run the following command:
source $HOME/.local/bin/env # or follow instructions

# install bagels through uv
uv tool install --python 3.13 bagels
```

`uv` can also be installed via Homebrew, Cargo, Winget, pipx, and more. See the [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more information.

#### Windows:

```bash
# install uv:
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
# then follow instructions to add uv to path
uv tool install --python 3.13 bagels
```
