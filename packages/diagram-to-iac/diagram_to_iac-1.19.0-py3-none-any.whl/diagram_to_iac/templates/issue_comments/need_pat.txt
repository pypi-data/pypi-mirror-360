‚è≥ **Waiting for Personal Access Token Configuration**

The deployment requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) to proceed with Terraform operations.

**Required Action:**
1. Set the `TFE_TOKEN` secret in your repository settings
2. Ensure the token has access to your Terraform Cloud workspace
3. Comment `retry` on this issue to resume the deployment

**Token Requirements:**
- Valid Terraform Cloud API token
- Workspace access permissions for: `{workspace_name}`
- Token should be added as repository secret: `TFE_TOKEN`

**Commit:** `{sha}`
**Waiting Since:** {timestamp}

Once the token is configured, comment `retry` to continue the deployment automatically.
