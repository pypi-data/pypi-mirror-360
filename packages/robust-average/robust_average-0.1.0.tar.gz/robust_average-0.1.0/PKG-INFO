## üìä Robust Average for Price Analysis

### What is Robust Average?
The `robust_average` function is a reusable Python module that intelligently selects the most meaningful average (mean, median, or mode) for a set of prices. It analyzes the data for outliers and skewness, then chooses the best statistical measure to represent the "typical" price, ensuring results are not distorted by extreme values or unusual distributions.

### Why Integrate Robust Average?
- **Real-world price data is often messy:** Scraped prices from APIs or the web can include outliers, errors, or highly skewed distributions.
- **Standard mean can be misleading:** A few very high or low prices can distort the mean, making it unrepresentative of what most buyers actually pay.
- **Business and legal accuracy:** In contracts, reporting, or compliance, using a misleading average can have legal or financial consequences. The robust average ensures you report the most defensible and meaningful value.

### Benefits
- **Automatic selection:** No need to manually inspect data for outliers or skewness‚Äîthe function does it for you.
- **Transparency:** Returns the method used (mean, median, or mode) and supporting statistics, so you can justify your results.
- **Reusability:** Can be used in any project or analysis where robust, reliable price statistics are needed.
- **Better decision-making:** Ensures that pricing, negotiation, and reporting are based on the most representative data, not distorted by anomalies.

### Example Usage
```python
from robust_average import robust_average
prices = [97.87, 109.99, 129.99, 89.99, 119.99, 500.00]
result = robust_average(prices)
print(result)
# Output: {'value': 109.99, 'method': 'median', ...}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This is a **Python-based project blueprint** ‚Äî simple to expand with:
- **APIs**: `requests` for HTTP calls to shipping & price services.
- **Data**: `pandas` for logging, exporting reports, and trends.
- **Optional Dashboard**: `Streamlit`, `Dash` or `Flask` for real-time monitoring.
- **Database**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or any relational DB for storing deals.

## üöÄ How It Works (Flow)

1. **STEP 1**: User inputs product details (name, SKU, VIN, year, weight, memory, size, quantity, destination, shipping method).
2. **STEP 2**: System fetches market retail prices, shipping costs, and FX rates.
3. **STEP 3**: Calculates total landed costs, profit margin, and walk-away price.
4. **STEP 4**: Compares multiple supplier offers and ranks them.
5. **STEP 5**: Approves or rejects the deal; sends alerts and negotiation suggestions.
6. **STEP 6**: Calculates final logistics costs, generates contract/PO.
7. **STEP 7**: (If agri-export) Matches local suppliers/farmers to international buyers.
8. **STEP 8**: Real-time dashboard and exportable reports.
9. **STEP 9**: Future enhancements like traceability, forecasting, fraud detection.

## üîó APIs & Integrations

- **Shipping**: Freightos, SeaRates, DHL, UPS, Aramex.
- **Price Comparison**: Local marketplaces (Jumia, Noon, Takealot, Konga), Google Shopping via SerpAPI.
- **FX Rates**: Free services like exchangerate.host or premium FX APIs.
- **Notifications**: Can integrate with email, Slack, or WhatsApp for team alerts.

## üö¶ Project Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Environment variable management for API keys (.env, python-dotenv)
- Integration with SerpAPI for product price scraping
- Country/domain lookup using Wikidata and DuckDB
- Flexible, case-insensitive country matching
- Product filtering based on user-specified criteria (name, memory, color)
- Robust average function for meaningful price analysis (mean/median/mode selection)
- Demo and playground scripts for data analysis and testing
- requirements.txt updated for all dependencies

### üîú To Do
- Generate and format analysis reports (Step 3 in demo_env.py)
- Save reports to files (Step 4)
- Implement user notification or report delivery (Step 5)
- Add more comprehensive error handling and logging
- Expand data validation and integrity checks
- Build a user interface or dashboard (optional/future)
- Add more unit and integration tests
- Improve documentation and usage examples
