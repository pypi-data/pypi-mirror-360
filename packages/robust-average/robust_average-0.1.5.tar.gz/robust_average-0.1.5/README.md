## üìä Robust Average for Price Analysis

### What is Robust Average?
The `robust_average` function is a reusable Python module that intelligently selects the most meaningful average (mean, median, or mode) for a list/Series of prices. It analyzes the data for outliers and skewness, then chooses the best statistical measure to represent the "typical" price, ensuring results are not distorted by extreme values or unusual distributions.

### Why Integrate Robust Average?
- **Real-world price data is often messy:** Scraped prices from APIs or the web can include outliers, errors, or highly skewed distributions.
- **Standard mean can be misleading:** A few very high or low prices can distort the mean, making it unrepresentative of what most buyers actually pay.
- **Business and legal accuracy:** In contracts, reporting, or compliance, using a misleading average can have legal or financial consequences. The robust average ensures you report the most defensible and meaningful value.

### Benefits
- **Automatic selection:** No need to manually inspect data for outliers or skewness‚Äîthe function does it for you.
- **Transparency:** Returns the method used (mean, median, or mode) and supporting statistics, so you can justify your results.
- **Reusability:** Can be used in any project or analysis where robust, reliable price statistics are needed.
- **Better decision-making:** Ensures that pricing, negotiation, and reporting are based on the most representative data, not distorted by anomalies.

### Decision Logic
The function uses a systematic approach to select the most appropriate average:

1. **Outlier Detection (IQR Method):**
   - Calculates Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
   - Defines outliers as values outside [Q1 - 1.5√óIQR, Q3 + 1.5√óIQR]
   - IQR = Q3 - Q1

2. **Skewness Analysis:**
   - Calculates the skewness coefficient using scipy.stats.skew()
   - Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution
   - Values close to 0 indicate symmetric distribution

3. **Decision Criteria:**
   - **Use MEAN if:** No outliers AND |skewness| < 0.5 (symmetric, clean data)
   - **Use MEDIAN if:** Outliers present OR |skewness| ‚â• 0.5 (skewed or contaminated data)
   - **Use MODE if:** A single value appears in >50% of the dataset (dominant price point)

4. **Mathematical Foundation:**
   - **Mean:** Best for normally distributed data without outliers
   - **Median:** Robust to outliers and skewed distributions
   - **Mode:** Most frequent value, useful for discrete price points

### Example Usage
```python
from robust_average import robust_average
prices = [97.87, 109.99, 129.99, 89.99, 119.99, 500.00]
result = robust_average(prices)
print(result)
# Output: {'value': 109.99, 'method': 'median', ...}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This is a **Python-based project blueprint** ‚Äî simple to expand with:
- **APIs**: `requests` for HTTP calls to shipping & price services.
- **Data**: `pandas` for logging, exporting reports, and trends.
- **Optional Dashboard**: `Streamlit`, `Dash` or `Flask` for real-time monitoring.
- **Database**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or any relational DB for storing deals.

## üöÄ How It Works (Flow)

1. **STEP 1**: User inputs product details (name, SKU, year, weight, memory, size, quantity, destination, shipping method).
2. **STEP 2**: System fetches market retail prices, shipping costs, and FX rates.
3. **STEP 3**: Calculates total landed costs, profit margin, and walk-away price.
4. **STEP 4**: Compares multiple supplier offers and ranks them.
5. **STEP 5**: Approves or rejects the deal; sends alerts and negotiation suggestions.
6. **STEP 6**: Calculates final logistics costs, generates contract/PO.
7. **STEP 7**: (If agri-export) Matches local suppliers/farmers to international buyers.
8. **STEP 8**: Real-time dashboard and exportable reports.
9. **STEP 9**: Future enhancements like traceability, forecasting, fraud detection.

## üîó APIs & Integrations

- **Shipping**: Freightos, SeaRates, DHL, UPS, Aramex.
- **Price Comparison**: Local marketplaces (Jumia, Noon, Takealot, Konga), Google Shopping via SerpAPI.
- **FX Rates**: Free services like exchangerate.host or premium FX APIs.
- **Notifications**: Can integrate with email, Slack, or WhatsApp for team alerts.
