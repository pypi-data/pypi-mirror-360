# Data Transmission

check the [chapter in the operatorâ€™s guide](../../operator_guide/concepts/data.md).

## Transmitting Data

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

Any satellite that wishes to transmit measurement data for storage should inherit from the
{cpp:class}`TransmitterSatellite <constellation::satellite::TransmitterSatellite>` class instead of the regular
{cpp:class}`Satellite <constellation::satellite::Satellite>` class.
This class implements the connection and transmission to data receivers in the Constellation in a transparent way.

Data will only be transmitted in the `RUN` state. It is always preceded by a begin-of-run (BOR) message sent by the framework
after the `starting()` function has successfully been executed, and it is followed by a end-of-run (EOR) message send
automatically after the `stopping()` function has succeeded.

Data messages are created and sent in three steps. First, the data message is created, optionally allocating the number of
frames it will contain if known already. Subsequently, these frames are added to the message:

```cpp
// Creating a new data message with two frames pre-allocated:
auto msg = newDataMessage(2);
msg.addFrame(std::move(frame0));
msg.addFrame(std::move(frame1));
```

```{hint}
C++ Move semantics `std::move` are strongly encouraged here in order to avoid copying memory as described below.
```

Finally, the message is send to the connected receiver via one of the following two methods:

* The data can be sent with a preconfigured timeout. If the transmitter fails to send the data within this configured time
  window, an exception is thrown and the satellite transitions into the `ERROR` state. This is the most commonly used method
  of transmitting data and ensuring that there is no data loss.

  ```cpp
  sendDataMessage(msg);
  ```

* The second option is to handle potential issues in transmitting the data in satellite code. In this case, the message
  should be sent via

  ```cpp
  auto sent = trySendDataMessage(msg);
  ```

  The boolean return value indicates if the sending was successful or failed. Either another attempt of sending the message
  can be undertaken, or the message can be discarded. It should be noted that the {cpp:func}`trySendDataMessage() <constellation::satellite::TransmitterSatellite::trySendDataMessage()>` method is annotated
  with the `[[nodiscard]]` keyword, indicating that the return value cannot be discarded and *has* to be used.

Data messages contain a header with the canonical name of the sending satellite, the current system time when creating the
message and a continuous sequence number. This means there is no need to separately count messages in user code.

## Data Format & Performance

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

Constellation makes no assumption on the data stored in message frames. All data is stored in frames, handled as binary blob
and transmitted as such. The message frames of data messages are designed for minimum data copy and maximum speed.
A data message can contain any number of frames.

The {cpp:func}`DataMessage::addFrame() <constellation::satellite::TransmitterSatellite::DataMessage::addFrame()>` function takes so-called payload buffer as argument.
Consequently, the data to be transmitted has to be converted into such a {cpp:class}`PayloadBuffer <constellation::message::PayloadBuffer>`.
For the most common C++ ranges like `std::vector` or `std::array`, moving the object into the payload buffer with `std::move()` is sufficient.

```{seealso}
Since the data transmission protocol as well as the event metadata come with additional overhead, the largest data throughput
depends on the frame size as well as on the number of frames transmitted by a single message. For performance considerations,
it is advised to read [Increase Data Rate in C++](../howtos/data_transmission_speed.md).

## Metadata

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

Constellation provides the option to attach metadata to each message sent by the satellite. There are three possibilities:

* Metadata available at the beginning of the run such as additional hardware information or firmware revisions can be attached
  to the begin-of-run (BOR) message. This has to be performed in the `starting()` function:

  ```cpp
  void ExampleSatellite::starting(std::string_view /*run_identifier*/) {
      setBORTag("firmware_version", version);
  }
  ```

  In addition to these user-provided tags, the payload of the BOR message contains the full satellite configuration.

* Similarly, for metadata only available at the end of the run such as aggregate statistics, end-of-run (EOR) tags can be set
  in the `stopping()` function:

  ```cpp
  void ExampleSatellite::stopping() {
      setEORTag("total_pixels", pixel_count);
  }
  ```

  In addition to these user-provided tags, the payload of the EOR message contains aggregate data on the run provided by the
  framework such as the total number of messages sent.

* Finally, metadata can be attached to each individual data message sent during the run:

  ```cpp
  // Create a new message
  auto msg = newDataMessage();

  // Add timestamps in picoseconds
  msg.addTag("timestamp_begin", ts_start_pico);
  msg.addTag("timestamp_end", ts_end_pico);
  ```
