I will try to\nincorporate the feedback in the book. See the book's preface for some general\nperspectives on what it tries to achieve, and which kind feedback will\nbe considered appropriate.\n\n# Thank you for your support\nYour support made it possible for this book to be written.\n\nBesides your personal monetary support, you can help improve the quality of the\nbook by simply publicly sharing your positive experience with the book and its code,\nthereby encouraging more people to support the project. You\nare also encouraged to give this and the supporting\n[fortitudo.tech](https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech)\nrepository a star.\n\nNo matter how much economic support this project realistically gets, it will only\nbe a small fraction of the opportunity costs from writing the book and making it\nfreely available online.
