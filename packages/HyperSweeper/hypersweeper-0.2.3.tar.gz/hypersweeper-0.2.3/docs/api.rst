Hypersweeper API
=================

These pages document the general interaction patterns for the Hypersweeper API.
Please note, however, that a familiarity with the optimizers is required to operate them since Hypersweeper is simply an interface.

For detailed considerations of how Hydra sweepers work generally, please see the [Hydra Sweeper documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/sweeping_parameters).
