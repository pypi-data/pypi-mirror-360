✌🏻 Hey there and thank you for using **PromptDifter**!

📋 Do the checklist before filing a feature request:

- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question in [Discussions](https://github.com/Code-and-Sorts/PromptDrifter/discussions).
- [ ] Are you logging a pesky bug 🐛? Post as a bug report instead of a feature request.

None of the above, create a feature request.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] 🤔 **Clearly** describe the new feature and a clear description of what you want to happen.
- [ ] 💭 If necessary, provide alternative solutions or features you have considered.
- [ ] 📸 Provide any additional context or screenshots about the feature request.
