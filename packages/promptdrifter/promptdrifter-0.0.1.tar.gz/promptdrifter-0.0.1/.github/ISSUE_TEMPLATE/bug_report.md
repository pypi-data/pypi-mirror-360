✌🏻 Hey there and thank you for using **PromptDifter**!

📋 Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question in [Discussions](https://github.com/Code-and-Sorts/PromptDrifter/discussions).
- [ ] Have an idea for a feature? Post as a feature request instead of a bug.


None of the above, create a bug report.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** example that reproduces the bug.
```python
# A bug lives here 🐛
```
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate.
- [ ] OS type and version (e.g. macOS 15.3).
