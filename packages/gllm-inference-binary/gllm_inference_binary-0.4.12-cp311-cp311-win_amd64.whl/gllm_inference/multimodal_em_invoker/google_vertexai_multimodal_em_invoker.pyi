class GoogleVertexAIMultimodalEMInvoker(BaseMultimodalEMInvoker[str | bytes]):
    """A class to interact with multimodal embedding models hosted through Google's Vertex AI API endpoints.

    The `GoogleVertexAIMultimodalEMInvoker` class is responsible for invoking a multimodal embedding model using the
    Google Vertex AI API. It uses the multimodal embedding model to transform a content or a list of contents
    into their vector representations.

    Attributes:
        model (MultiModalEmbeddingModel): The multimodal embedding model to be used for embedding the input content.
        embedding_dimension (int): The dimension of the embedding vector.

    Notes:
        In order to use the `GoogleVertexAIMultimodalEMInvoker`, a credentials JSON file for a Google Cloud service
        account with the Vertex AI API enabled must be provided. For more information on how to create the credentials
        file, please refer to the following pages:
        1. https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials.
        2. https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials.

        The `GoogleVertexAIMultimodalEMInvoker` currently supports the following contents:
        1. Text, which can be passed as plain strings.
        2. Image, which can be passed as:
            1. Base64 encoded image bytes.
            2. URL pointing to an image.
            3. Local image file path.
        4. Video, which can be passed as:
            1. Base64 encoded video bytes.
            2. URL pointing to a video.
            3. Local video file path.
