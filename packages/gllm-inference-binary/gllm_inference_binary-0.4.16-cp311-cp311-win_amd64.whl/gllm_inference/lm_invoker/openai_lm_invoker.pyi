class OpenAILMInvoker(BaseLMInvoker):
    '''A language model invoker to interact with OpenAI language models.

    Attributes:
        model_id (str): The model ID of the language model.
        client (AsyncOpenAI): The OpenAI client instance.
        default_hyperparameters (dict[str, Any]): Default hyperparameters for invoking the model.
        tools (list[Any]): The list of tools provided to the model to enable tool calling.
        response_schema (ResponseSchema | None): The schema of the response. If provided, the model will output a
            structured response as defined by the schema. Supports both Pydantic BaseModel and JSON schema dictionary.
        output_analytics (bool): Whether to output the invocation analytics.
        retry_config (RetryConfig): The retry configuration for the language model.
        reasoning_effort (ReasoningEffort | None): The reasoning effort for reasoning models. Not allowed
            for non-reasoning models. If None, the model will perform medium reasoning effort.
        reasoning_summary (ReasoningSummary | None): The reasoning summary level for reasoning models. Not allowed
            for non-reasoning models. If None, no summary will be generated.

    Input types:
        1. Text.
        2. Document: ".pdf".
        3. Image: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", and ".webp".
        Non-text inputs must be of valid file extensions and can be passed as an `Attachment` object.

        Non-text inputs can only be passed with the `user` role.

        Usage example:
        ```python
        text = "What animal is in this image?"
        image = Attachment.from_path("path/to/local/image.png")

        prompt = [(PromptRole.USER, [text, image])]
        result = await lm_invoker.invoke(prompt)
        ```

    Tool calling:
        Tool calling is a feature that allows the language model to call tools to perform tasks.
        Tools can be passed to the via the `tools` parameter as a list of LangChain\'s `Tool` objects.
        When tools are provided and the model decides to call a tool, the tool calls are stored in the
        `tool_calls` attribute in the output.

        Usage example:
        ```python
        lm_invoker = OpenAILMInvoker(..., tools=[tool_1, tool_2])
        ```

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Let me call the tools...",
            tool_calls=[
                ToolCall(id="123", name="tool_1", args={"key": "value"}),
                ToolCall(id="456", name="tool_2", args={"key": "value"}),
            ]
        )
        ```

    Structured output:
        Structured output is a feature that allows the language model to output a structured response.
        This feature can be enabled by providing a schema to the `response_schema` parameter.

        The schema must be either a JSON schema dictionary or a Pydantic BaseModel class.
        If JSON schema is used, it must be compatible with Pydantic\'s JSON schema, especially for complex schemas.
        For this reason, it is recommended to create the JSON schema using Pydantic\'s `model_json_schema` method.

        The language model also doesn\'t need to stream anything when structured output is enabled. Thus, standard
        invocation will be performed regardless of whether the `event_emitter` parameter is provided or not.

        When enabled, the structured output is stored in the `structured_output` attribute in the output.
        1. If the schema is a JSON schema dictionary, the structured output is a dictionary.
        2. If the schema is a Pydantic BaseModel class, the structured output is a Pydantic model.

        # Example 1: Using a JSON schema dictionary
        Usage example:
        ```python
        schema = {
            "title": "Animal",
            "description": "A description of an animal.",
            "properties": {
                "color": {"title": "Color", "type": "string"},
                "name": {"title": "Name", "type": "string"},
            },
            "required": ["name", "color"],
            "type": "object",
        }
        lm_invoker = OpenAILMInvoker(..., response_schema=schema)
        ```
        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(structured_output={"name": "Golden retriever", "color": "Golden"})
        ```

        # Example 2: Using a Pydantic BaseModel class
        Usage example:
        ```python
        class Animal(BaseModel):
            name: str
            color: str

        lm_invoker = OpenAILMInvoker(..., response_schema=Animal)
        ```
        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(structured_output=Animal(name="Golden retriever", color="Golden"))
        ```

    Analytics tracking:
        Analytics tracking is a feature that allows the module to output additional information about the invocation.
        This feature can be enabled by setting the `output_analytics` parameter to `True`.
        When enabled, the following attributes will be stored in the output:
        1. `token_usage`: The token usage.
        2. `duration`: The duration in seconds.
        3. `finish_details`: The details about how the generation finished.

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Golden retriever is a good dog breed.",
            token_usage=TokenUsage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=50),
            duration=0.729,
            finish_details={"status": "completed", "incomplete_details": {"reason": None}},
        )
        ```

    Retry and timeout:
        The `OpenAILMInvoker` supports retry and timeout configuration.
        By default, the max retries is set to 0 and the timeout is set to 30.0 seconds.
        They can be customized by providing a custom `RetryConfig` object to the `retry_config` parameter.

        Retry config examples:
        ```python
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=0, timeout=0.0)  # No retry, no timeout
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=0, timeout=10.0)  # No retry, 10.0 seconds timeout
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=5, timeout=0.0)  # 5 max retries, no timeout
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=5, timeout=10.0)  # 5 max retries, 10.0 seconds timeout
        ```

        Usage example:
        ```python
        lm_invoker = OpenAILMInvoker(..., retry_config=retry_config)
        ```

    Reasoning:
        OpenAI\'s o-series models are classified as reasoning models. Reasoning models think before they answer,
        producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. Reasoning models excel in
        complex problem solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning for agentic workflows.

        The reasoning effort of reasoning models can be set via the `reasoning_effort` parameter. This parameter
        will guide the models on how many reasoning tokens it should generate before creating a response to the prompt.
        Available options include:
        1. "low": Favors speed and economical token usage.
        2. "medium": Favors a balance between speed and reasoning accuracy.
        3. "high": Favors more complete reasoning at the cost of more tokens generated and slower responses.
        When not set, the reasoning effort will be equivalent to `medium` by default.

        OpenAI doesn\'t expose the raw reasoning tokens. However, the summary of the reasoning tokens can still be
        generated. The summary level can be set via the `reasoning_summary` parameter. Available options include:
        1. "auto": The model decides the summary level automatically.
        2. "detailed": The model will generate a detailed summary of the reasoning tokens.
        Reasoning summary is not compatible with tool calling.
        When enabled, the reasoning summary will be stored in the `reasoning` attribute in the output.

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Golden retriever is a good dog breed.",
            reasoning=[Reasoning(id="x", reasoning="Let me think about it...")],
        )
        ```

        When streaming is enabled along with reasoning summary, the reasoning summary token will be streamed with the
        `EventType.DATA` event type.

        Streaming output example:
        ```python
        {"type": "data", "value": "Let me think ", ...}  # Reasoning summary token
        {"type": "data", "value": "about it...", ...}  # Reasoning summary token
        {"type": "response", "value": "Golden retriever ", ...}  # Response token
        {"type": "response", "value": "is a good dog breed.", ...}  # Response token
        ```

        Setting reasoning-related parameters for non-reasoning models will raise an error.

    Output types:
        The output of the `OpenAILMInvoker` is of type `MultimodalOutput`, which is a type alias that can represent:
        1. `str`: The text response if no additional output is needed.
        2. `LMOutput`: A Pydantic model with the following attributes if any additional output is needed:
            2.1. response (str): The text response.
            2.2. tool_calls (list[ToolCall]): The tool calls, if the `tools` parameter is defined and the language
