           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# open-stocks-mcp

**🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧**

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server providing access to stock market data through open-source APIs like Robin Stocks.

## Project Intent

This project aims to create a standardized interface for LLM applications to access stock market data, portfolio information, and trading capabilities through the Model Context Protocol.

### Planned Features
- Real-time stock price data
- Portfolio management tools  
- Market analysis capabilities
- Historical data access
- Trading alerts and notifications

## Status

- ✅ **Foundation**: MCP server scaffolding complete
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, testing, and publishing pipeline established
- ✅ **Package**: Published to PyPI as `open-stocks-mcp` (v0.1.1)
- ✅ **Communication**: Server/client MCP communication verified working
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Robin Stocks API integration
- 📋 **Next**: Core stock market tools implementation

## Installation

Install the Open Stocks MCP server via pip:

```bash
pip install open-stocks-mcp
```

For development installation from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Agent-Tools/open-stocks-mcp.git
cd open-stocks-mcp
uv pip install -e .
```

## Credential Management

The Open Stocks MCP server uses Robin Stocks for market data access, which requires Robinhood account credentials.

### Setting Up Credentials

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD=your_password
```

2. Secure your credentials:
   - Never commit the `.env` file to version control
   - Ensure proper file permissions: `chmod 600 .env`
   - Consider using a password manager or secure credential storage

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

If your Robinhood account has MFA enabled you will have a pop up in the mobile app, 
it is recommended to have your app open during login.

## Starting the MCP Server Locally

### Via Command Line

Start the server in stdio transport mode (for MCP clients):

```bash
# Using the installed package
open-stocks-mcp-server --transport stdio

# For development with auto-reload
uv run open-stocks-mcp-server --transport stdio
```

### Testing the Server

Use the MCP Inspector for interactive testing:

```bash
# Run the inspector with the server (mcp CLI required)
uv run mcp dev src/open_stocks_mcp/server/app.py
```

Note: The `mcp` command is installed with the `mcp[cli]` package dependency.

## Adding the MCP Client to an ADK Agent

To integrate Open Stocks MCP with your ADK (Agent Development Kit) agent:

### 1. Update MCP Settings

Add the server to your MCP settings configuration (typically in `mcp_settings.json` or similar):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-stocks": {
      "command": "open-stocks-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Claude Desktop Integration

For Claude Desktop app, add to your configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-stocks": {
      "command": "open-stocks-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```


### 3. Available Tools

Once connected, your agent will have access to tools like:
- `get_portfolio` - Retrieve current portfolio holdings and values
- `get_stock_orders` - Get list of stock orders and their status
- (More tools coming in future versions)

## Current Functionality (v0.1.1)

The package currently includes:

### Robin Stocks Authentication
- **Environment-based login**: Stores credentials in `.env` file
- **Auto-login flow**: Automatic credential detection and login on server startup
- **MFA Support**: Mobile app notification for accounts with MFA enabled

## Testing

### Basic Tests
Run the basic test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Login Flow Integration Tests
Test the complete login flow with real credentials from `.env`:

```bash
# Run all tests including integration tests
uv run pytest -m integration

# Run specific login flow tests
uv run pytest tests/test_server_login_flow.py -v

# Run without integration tests (no credentials needed)
uv run pytest -m "not integration"
```

**Note**: Integration tests require valid `ROBINHOOD_USERNAME` and `ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file. These tests mock the actual Robin Stocks API calls to avoid real authentication attempts.

### Test Categories
- **Unit tests**: Basic functionality without external dependencies
- **Integration tests**: Login flow tests using real credentials (but mocked API calls)
- **Slow tests**: Performance and stress tests (marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`)

For development with auto-reloading:

```bash
uv run pytest --watch
```
