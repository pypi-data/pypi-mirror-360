# Snailz

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvwilson/snailz/refs/heads/main/pages/img/snailz-logo.svg" alt="snail logo" width="200px">

`snailz` is a synthetic data generator
that models a study of snails in the Pacific Northwest
which are growing to unusual size as a result of exposure to pollution.
The package can generate fully-reproducible datasets of varying sizes and with varying statistical properties,
and is intended primarily for classroom use.
For example,
an instructor can give each learner a unique dataset to analyze,
while learners can test their analysis pipelines using datasets they generate themselves.

> *The Story*
>
> Years ago,
> logging companies dumped toxic waste in a remote region of Vancouver Island.
> As the containers leaked and the pollution spread,
> some snails in the region began growing unusually large.
> Your team is now collecting and analyzing specimens from affected regions
> to determine if exposure to pollution is responsible.

`snailz` generates three related sets of data:

-   Grids: the survey grids where pollution levels are measured.
-   Persons: the scientists conducting the study.
-   Samples: the snails collected from the survey sites.

## Usage

1.  `pip install snailz` (or the equivalent command for your Python environment).
1.  `snailz --help` to see available commands.

To generate example data in a fresh directory:

```
# Create and activate Python virtual environment
$ uv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# Install snailz and dependencies
$ uv pip install snailz

# Write default parameter values to the ./params.json file
$ snailz --defaults > params.json

# Generate all output files in the ./data directory
$ snailz --params params.json --outdir data
```

## Parameters

`snailz` reads controlling parameters from a JSON file,
and can generate a file with default parameter values as a starting point.
The parameters, their meanings, and their properties are:

## Data Dictionary

All of the generated data is stored in CSV files.

### Grids

The pollution readings for each survey grid are stored in a file <code>G<em>nnnn</em>.csv</code> (e.g., `G0003.csv`).
These CSV files do *not* have column headers;
instead, each contains a square integer matrix of pollution readings.
A typical file is:

```
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
```

| `when`      | date sample collected    | date, required         |
| `mass`      | sample weight in grams   | real, required         |

The output directory also contains a file called `changes.json`
that records parameters used to alter data,
such as the daily growth rate of snails
and the ID of the clumsy scientist whose measurements have systematic errors.

## Colophon

`snailz` was inspired by the [Palmer Penguins][penguins] dataset
and by conversations with [Rohan Alexander][alexander-rohan]
about his book [*Telling Stories with Data*][telling-stories].

The snail logo was created by [sunar.ko][snail-logo].

My thanks to everyone who built the tools this project relies on, including:

-   [`pydantic`][pydantic] for storing and validating data (including parameters).
-   [`pytest`][pytest] and [`faker`][faker] for testing.
-   [`ruff`][ruff] for checking the code.
-   [`uv`][uv] for managing packages and the virtual environment.
