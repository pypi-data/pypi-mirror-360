# Dashboard Package

The `dashboard` package provides all the necessary components to build and run the Streamlit user interface. It is organized into three main parts:

-   **Service**: The core logic and state management for the application.
-   **Plots**: Functions dedicated to creating visualizations.
-   **Widgets**: Reusable UI components for displaying specific analyses.
