# QuackNet

**QuackNet** is a Python based building and training neural networks and convolutional networks entirely from scratch. It offers foundational implementations of key components such as forward propagation, backpropagation and optimisation algorithms, without relying on machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch

## Key Features

**1. Custom Implementation:**
-   Fully handwritten layers, activation functions and loss functions.
-   No reliance on external libraries for machine learning (except for numpy)

**2. Core neural network functionality:**
-   Support for common activation functions (eg.Leaky ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax)
-   Multiple loss functions with derivatives (eg. MSE, MAE, Cross entropy)

**3. Training:**
-   includes backpropagation for gradient calculation and parameter updates
-   Optimisers: Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adam optimiser.
-   Supports batching for efficient training.

**4. Layer Support:**
-   Fully Connected Layer (Dense)
-   Convolutional
-   Pooling (Max and Average)
-   Global Average Pooling
-   Activation Layers

**5. Additional Features:**
-   Save and load model weights and biases.
-   Evaluation metrics including accuracy and loss.
-   Visualisation tools for training progress.
-   Demo projects like MNIST and HAM10000 classification.

## Installation

QuackNet is simple to install via PyPI.

**Install via PyPI**

```
pip install QuackNet
```

## Usage Example

```Python
from quacknet.main import Network

# Define a neural network architecture
n = Network(
    lossFunc = "cross entropy",
    learningRate = 0.01,
    optimisationFunc = "sgd", #stochastic gradient descent
)
n.addLayer(3, "relu") # Input layer
n.addLayer(2, "relu") # Hidden layer
n.addLayer(1, "softmax") # Output layer
n.createWeightsAndBiases()

# Example data
inputData = [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]
labels = [[1], [0]]

# Train the network
accuracy, averageLoss = n.train(inputData, labels, epochs = 10)

# Evaluate
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}%")
print(f"Average loss: {averageLoss}")
```
