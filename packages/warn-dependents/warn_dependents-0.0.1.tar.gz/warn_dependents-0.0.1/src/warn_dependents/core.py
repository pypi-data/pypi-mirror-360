Dear {maintainers_and_authors_given_names or "Sir/Madam"},

The developers of {upstream_project_name} (including myself) are considering dropping 
support for Pythons older than version {min_python_version_str}.  Any feedback 
about this is most welcome on our discussions page:
{url}
particularly if it would have adverse effects for your projects: {", ".join(projects_data)}.

No projects will be broken, as no old versions of {upstream_project_name} will be yanked.  This
decision would just mean your own users, that use older Python versions, would 
not be able to install the latest version of {upstream_project_name}.  If new bugs in older versions
of {upstream_project_name} for older Pythons are found, the default advice would become "upgrade Python to 
a supported version".

Thanks for using {upstream_project_name}!

{sender_name}.

    
P.S. You have received this email because all of the following conditions have been met:
i) Your projects: {", ".join(projects_data)} are listed as reverse dependencies of {upstream_project_name} on Wheelodex.
ii) For a Python version we propose to drop, no clause was found to prevent installation of each of these projects.   
iii) For each of these projects, either there were no Python version trove classifiers, or they included a 
Python version we propose to drop.
