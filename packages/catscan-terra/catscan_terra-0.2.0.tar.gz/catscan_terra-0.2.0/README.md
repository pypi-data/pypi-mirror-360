# CatSCAN

**Terraform Cloud multi-workspace scanner**

CatSCAN is a simple, interactive CLI tool that uses the Terraform Cloud API to scan all workspaces in your organization and display a summary of resources currently running. It features an old-school ASCII aesthetic and a menu-driven interface for browsing your previous scan history.

---

## Features

* Fetches all workspaces from Terraform Cloud
* Downloads and parses the current state for each workspace
* Counts and summarizes resource types across workspaces
* Interactive history viewer with detailed scan records
* ASCII-art banner and menu-driven UI via Rich
* Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS/Linux)

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install catscan-terra
```

Or install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudsifar/catscan.git
cd catscan
pip install --editable .
```

---

## Usage

Run the scanner:

```bash
catscan
```

Or via Python module:

```bash
python -m catscan
```

### Command Options

After starting, CatSCAN will prompt you to configure your Terraform Cloud organization and API token (unless set via environment variables `TFC_ORG_NAME` and `TFC_TOKEN`).

During a scan, youâ€™ll see progress spinners and a final summary table. Options after a scan:

* **H**: View scan history
* **R**: Run another scan
* **Q**: Quit

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

For non-interactive or CI usage, export:

* `TFC_ORG_NAME` â€“ your Terraform Cloud organization name
* `TFC_TOKEN` â€“ a Terraform Cloud API token

```bash
export TFC_ORG_NAME="my-org"
export TFC_TOKEN="abcdef1234567890"
```

### Interactive Setup

If no environment variables are found, CatSCAN will prompt you to enter and optionally persist your credentials in your shell configuration (or on Windows, the user environment).
