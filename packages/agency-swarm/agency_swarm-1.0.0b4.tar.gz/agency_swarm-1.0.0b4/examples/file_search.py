"""
FileSearch Example - Agency Swarm v1.x

This example demonstrates how to use the FileSearch tool with Agency Swarm.
The agent automatically creates a vector store and indexes files for search.

Features demonstrated:
- Automatic vector store creation from files_folder
- FileSearchTool automatically added to agent
- Persistent vector store (survives multiple runs)
- Needle-in-haystack search capabilities
- Citation-backed responses

The example uses fabricated research data to demonstrate true "needle in haystack" functionality.
