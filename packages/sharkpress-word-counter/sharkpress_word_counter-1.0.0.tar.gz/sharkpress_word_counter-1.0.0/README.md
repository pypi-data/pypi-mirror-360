# URL Word Counter

A Python tool that counts words in the main content of web pages, ignoring cookie banners, headers, and footers. It uses Selenium with a headless Chrome browser to properly render JavaScript-heavy websites.

## Features

- Extracts main content from web pages
- Ignores cookie banners, headers, and footers
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content
- Provides word count and content preview
- Simple command-line interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Chrome (required for Selenium)

### Option 1: Install from source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd url-word-counter
   ```

2. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Option 2: Install directly from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/url-word-counter.git
```

### Option 3: Install with pip

```bash
pip install url-word-counter
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

After installation, you can run the URL Word Counter from the command line:

```bash
url-word-counter [URL] [--no-headless]
```

- `URL`: (Optional) The URL to analyze. If not provided, you'll be prompted to enter one.
- `--no-headless`: (Optional) Run the browser in non-headless mode (visible browser window).

Example:
```bash
url-word-counter https://www.example.com/
```

### Python API

You can also use the URL Word Counter in your Python code:

```python
from url_word_counter import URLWordCounter

# Initialize the counter
counter = URLWordCounter()

# Get word count for a URL
word_count, preview, error = counter.get_word_count("https://www.example.com/")

if error:
    print(f"Error: {error}")
else:
    print(f"Word count: {word_count:,}")
    print(f"Preview: {preview}")

# Don't forget to close the browser when done
counter.close()
```

## Example

```
üõ†Ô∏è  Advanced URL Word Counter (with JavaScript support)
============================================================

üöÄ Initializing browser...

üåê Enter URL (or 'q' to quit): https://www.example.com/

üîç Analyzing https://www.example.com/...

üìä Word count (main content only): 1,234

üìù Content preview: This is a preview of the extracted content from the webpage...
```

## How It Works

The script uses:
- Selenium WebDriver with Chrome in headless mode
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Smart content extraction that focuses on the main content area
- Word counting that ignores HTML tags and scripts

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome
- ChromeDriver (automatically installed by webdriver-manager)
