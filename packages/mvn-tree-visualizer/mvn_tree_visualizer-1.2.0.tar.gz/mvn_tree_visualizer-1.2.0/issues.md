# Project Improvement Suggestions for mvn-tree-visualizer

This document outlines potential improvements and new features for the `mvn-tree-visualizer` project. These are intended to be constructive suggestions to enhance the project's appeal, usability, and maintainability.

## üöÄ Features & Functionality

### 1. Support for Multiple Output Formats

**Status:** ‚úÖ Done


### 2. Dependency Highlighting and Filtering

*   **Description:** In large projects, the dependency graph can be overwhelming. Allowing users to highlight or filter specific dependencies would make the visualization much more useful.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   `--highlight <dependency>`: Highlight a specific dependency and its direct and transitive dependencies in the graph.
    *   `--filter <dependency>`: Show only a specific dependency and its direct and transitive dependencies.
    *   `--exclude <dependency>`: Exclude a specific dependency from the graph.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add the corresponding options to the CLI.
    *   Modify the `_convert_to_mermaid` function to handle the highlighting and filtering logic. This might involve adding CSS classes to the Mermaid diagram and styling them in the HTML template.

### 3. Display Dependency Versions

**Status:** ‚úÖ Done


### 4. "Watch" Mode

*   **Description:** A "watch" mode that automatically regenerates the diagram whenever the `maven_dependency_file` changes would be a great convenience for developers.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   Add a `--watch` flag to the CLI.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Use a library like `watchdog` to monitor the file system for changes.

## ‚ú® User Experience & Usability

### 1. Improved Visual Appearance

*   **Description:** While the current diagram is functional, its visual appearance could be improved to make it more modern and appealing.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   **Customizable Themes:** Allow users to choose from different color themes for the diagram.
    *   **Better Layout:** Experiment with different Mermaid layout options to find the one that works best for dependency graphs.
    *   **Interactive Features:** Add features like tooltips to show more information about a dependency when the user hovers over it.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add a `--theme` option to the CLI.
    *   Modify the `TEMPLATE.py` file to include different CSS styles for the themes.
    *   Explore the Mermaid.js documentation for more advanced features.

### 2. Informative Error Messages

*   **Description:** The tool could benefit from more informative error messages to help users diagnose problems.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   If the `maven_dependency_file` is not found, provide a clear message indicating the expected file name and location.
    *   If there is an error parsing the dependency tree, provide a message that helps the user identify the problematic line in the file.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Add more specific `try...except` blocks to the code to catch different types of errors and provide custom messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Quality & Maintainability

### 1. Unit Tests

**Status:** ‚úÖ Done


### 2. Code Modularity

*   **Description:** The code is generally well-structured, but it could be made more modular by separating concerns.
*   **Suggestions:**
    *   Create a separate module for parsing the Maven dependency tree. This would make the code easier to test and reuse.
    *   Move the `HTML_TEMPLATE` to a separate `.html` file and load it using a template engine like Jinja2. This is already being done, which is great!
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Create a new file `src/mvn_tree_visualizer/parser.py` and move the dependency parsing logic into it.

### 3. Type Hinting
