        Version 3, 29 June 2007
        
        Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        <https://fsf.org/>
        
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
        license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
        terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
        supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
        ## 0. Additional Definitions.
        
        As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the
        GNU General Public License.
        
        "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
        than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
        An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
        A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".
        
        The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
        The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
        ## 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
        ## 2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:
        
        -   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
            to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
            function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        -   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
            this License applicable to that copy.
        
        ## 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
        header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
        -   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
            covered by this License.
        -   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
            license document.
        
        ## 4. Combined Works.
        
        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
        
        -   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
            covered by this License.
        -   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
            license document.
        -   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
            these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
            copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        -   d) Do one of the following:
            -   0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
                this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
                suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
                the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
                manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                Corresponding Source.
            -   1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
                the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run
                time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
                computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
                version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
                Linked Version.
        -   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
            otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
            of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
            necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
            Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application
            with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
            4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
            Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
            use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in
            the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
            Corresponding Source.)
        
        ## 5. Combined Libraries.
        
        You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
        side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:
        
        -   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
        -   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
            is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
            accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
        ## 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
        as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
        GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to
        it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
        of that published version or of any later version published by the
        Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
        specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you
        may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
        published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
        If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

# Diamond Shovel

> 面向目标的自动化漏洞发现和渗透测试框架

![Python 3.13](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.13-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)

## 简介

项目名来源: Minecraft同款名[Diamond Shovel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_shovel)

<details>
<summary>项目名原因</summary>

~~你能指望一大群理工人怎么起名=-=~~

嗯, 至少在中文语境下, 铲子是用来挖洞的, 安全漏洞简称洞, 就先叫`Shovel`了

至于`Diamond`的话, 我也不知道=-=

</details>

这个框架本身并不会做太多的事情, 而是起到了类似于免疫系统中<cite>[树突状细胞][1]</cite>的作用, 
将目标信息呈递给各个插件, 并允许插件在*Diamond Shovel*的*平台*上进行信息交换,
省去了安全研究人员在日常工作中大量的虐待`Ctrl` `C`和`V`键的工作, 
让他们更加专注于思考和脱发, 并通过在*Diamond Shovel*编写或使用插件来提高他们的效率.

## 使用方法

请注意, 正如上述简介所述, *Diamond Shovel*本身并不会做太多的事情, 您需要通过编写插件或者安装额外的插件来达到您的需要.

您可以在[这里](https://github.com/ansanyuan/shovel-default-plugins)找到我们预先免费提供的插件, 但请注意社区版钻石铲并不能正确识别`.ore`结尾的插件包.

### 安装

参见[安装方法](docs/install.md)

### 钻石铲命令行调用办法

参见[命令行调用](docs/cmdline.md)

### 钻石铲插件开发

参见[插件开发](docs/plugin-dev.md)

## 贡献

如果您遇到了Bug, 或者是想为钻石铲做一些什么, 请参考[贡献指南](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 不同版本

是的, 除去这个开源的版本外, 钻石铲有一个商业版的闭源分支, 而商业版的模式将与开源版的结构大不相同, 使用方式也有很大幅度的变动

与商业版的比较以及商业版相关文档将置于[github.io文档](https://diamond-shovel.github.io/shovel-wiki)上

## 开源许可

钻石铲社区版是一个开源项目, 由[LGPL-3.0](LICENSE)许可证保护.
