## Motivation

### Goals

- Provide to Xarray geospatial extensions a set of convenient tools for dealing
  with coordinate reference systems ({term}`CRS`) in a uniform & flexible way.
- Prevent duplicating CRS-specific logic (e.g., parse, reset, formatting,
  checking equality, etc.) in each extension ; put it together into one reusable
  package instead (i.e., a lightweight Xarray extension mostly built on top of
  [Pyproj]).
- Provide a common end-user API for handling CRS via
  {ref}`Xarray accessors <proj_accessors>`.
- Leverage recent Xarray features such as custom indexes. Easily compare,
  combine or align Xarray datasets or dataarrays based on their CRS (via
  {class}`~xproj.CRSIndex`).
- Consolidate the Xarray geospatial ecosystem (towards better interoperability).

### Non-Goals

- Being strongly opinionated on how CRS and other information like spatial
  dimensions should be represented as metadata in Xarray objects and/or in
  Xarray supported I/O formats. This is left to other Xarray extensions and
  format specifications.
- Provide a common set of tools (implementations) for re-projecting and/or
  resampling data. This highly depends on the data type (i.e., raster, vector,
  etc.) or application and it is best handled by other Xarray extensions. We
  also see XProj potentially as a lightweight dependency common to those other
  extensions so we want to restrict XProj's dependencies to the minimum (i.e.,
  Xarray and PyProj).
