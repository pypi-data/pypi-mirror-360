    This new version of ``python-neutronclient`` does not include the
    command line interface code. The "neutron" script is no longer
    supported. This project only contains the OpenStack Client bindings
    that are currently being moved to OpenStack SDK
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1999774>_.
deprecations:

    This project no longer provides CLI support. All code has been removed.
    Please use openstack CLI instead. See `openstack CLI command list
    <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-list.html>`_.
