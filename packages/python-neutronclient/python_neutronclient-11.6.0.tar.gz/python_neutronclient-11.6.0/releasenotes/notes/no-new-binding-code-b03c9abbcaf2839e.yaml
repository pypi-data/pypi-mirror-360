    Openstack community decided to use one SDK for its services, that is
    in ``openstacksdk`` repository. To avoid duplication, sooner or later the
    python binding code in ``python-neutronclient`` will be deprecated, and
    ``Neutron`` team decided on the ``2023.1 (Antelope)`` PTG to not allow
    new features\' bindings implemented here.
