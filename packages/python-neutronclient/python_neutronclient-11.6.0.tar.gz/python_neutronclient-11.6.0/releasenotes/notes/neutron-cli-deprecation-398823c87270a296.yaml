    ``neutron`` CLI will be removed in 'Z' release.
    While it has been marked as deprecated for removal for long,
    all features in ``neutron`` CLI have been supported in ``openstack`` CLI
    (OpenStackClient) as of Xena release and the neutron team plans to
    remove it in 'Z' release. Consider using ``openstack`` CLI and
    `Mapping Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/decoder.html#neutron-cli>`__
    in the OSC documentation would help you.
