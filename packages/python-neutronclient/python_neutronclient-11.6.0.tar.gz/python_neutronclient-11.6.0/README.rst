==================================

    :target: https://pypi.org/project/python-neutronclient/
    :alt: Latest Version

This is a client library for Neutron built on the Neutron API. It
provides a Python API (the ``neutronclient`` module).

.. note:: This project has been deprecated. The CLI code has been deleted
   and is not accessible anymore. The Python bindings are still in use by
   other projects but no new features will be added to this project.
   All projects under Openstack governance migrating to use OpenstackSDK.
   Any new feature should be proposed to OpenStack SDK and OpenStack
   Client.
