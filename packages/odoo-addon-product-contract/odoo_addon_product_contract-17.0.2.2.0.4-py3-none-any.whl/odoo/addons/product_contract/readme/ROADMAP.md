- There's no support right now for computing the start date for the
  following recurrent types: daily, weekly and monthlylastday.
- It would be interesting to be able to configure what to display in
  the line description using a configuration option, but using
  _compute_name is not valid because, if nothing is configured,
  it would reset what we have in the description.
