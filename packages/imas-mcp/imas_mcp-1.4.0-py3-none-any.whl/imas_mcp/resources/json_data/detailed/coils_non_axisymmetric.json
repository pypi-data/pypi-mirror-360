We define a coordinate system associated to each element as follows: for the arc and circle elements: binormal = (start point - center) x (intermediate point - center). This vector points in the direction of the circle / arc axis. normal = (center - point on curve). The normal vector will rotate as the point moves around the curve. Tangent = normal x binormal. For the line element we require an extra point, using the currently redundant intermediate point to define the line element's normal axis. The local coordinates for the line element then become: tangent = end point - start point; normal = intermediate point - start point; binormal = tangent x normal. It is assumed that all the axes above are normalized such that they have a unit length.\nCONTAINER[coils_non_axisymmetric/coil/conductor/elements/centres]: Position of the centre of the arc of a circle of every element (meaningful only if type/index = 2 or 3, fill with default/empty value otherwise)",
