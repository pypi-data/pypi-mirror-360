# MetaSBT

MetaSBT is a scalable framework designed to automatically index microbial genomes and accurately characterize metagenome-assembled genomes using Sequence Bloom Trees.

üëâ Get started with MetaSBT by visiting our [official wiki](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/wiki).

We also maintain a collection of public databases built with MetaSBT from curated sets of microbial genomes. You can explore and use them from the [MetaSBT-DBs](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT-DBs) repository.

> [!NOTE]
> Interested in using MetaSBT or our databases, or building your own private database but lack the necessary computational resources?
> Reach out to us! We‚Äôre always open to collaborations.
