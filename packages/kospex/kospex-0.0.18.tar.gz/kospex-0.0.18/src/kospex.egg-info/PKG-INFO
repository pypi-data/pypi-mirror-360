# kospex

Kospex is a CLI which aims to _"look at the guts of your code"_ to help gain insights into your developers and technology landscape.
It uses database structure from the excellent [Mergestat lite](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat-lite) to model data from git repositories.

For details on changes, see  the [changelog](https://github.com/kospex/kospex/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Installation, setup and usage

See the official [installation documentation](https://kospex.io/getting-started)

## What is a kospex?

We're aiming to [k]now your c[o]de by in[spe]cting the haruspe[x].
From Wikipedia, _The Latin terms haruspex and haruspicina are from an archaic word, hÄ«ra = "entrails, intestines"_

So we're going to help look at the "guts of your code" to gain an understanding of the applications, technology landscape (sprawl?) and developers.
