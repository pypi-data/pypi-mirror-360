## Overview
`aurora-neware` provides a standalone Python API and command line interface (CLI) to control Neware cylers.

It is designed for BTS 8.0 and WHW-200L-160CH-B systems, and should work on other cyclers using BTS 8.0.

## Features
- CLI and Python API
- Connect to Neware cyclers
- Retrieve status, data, logs
- Start and stop experiments

## Installation
Install on a Windows PC with BTS server and client 8.0, connected to one or more Neware cyclers with the API activated.

In a Python >3.12 environment, run:
```
pip install aurora-neware
```

## CLI usage

See commands and arguments with
```
neware --help
neware <COMMAND> --help
```

E.g. to check the status of all channels use
```
neware status
```

To start a job use
```
neware start "pipeline_id" "my_sample" "my_protocol.xml"
```

A `pipeline` is defined by `{Device ID}-{Sub-device ID}-{Channel ID}`, e.g. `"100-2-3"` for machine 100, sub-device 2, channel 3.

## API usage

Commands are also available through Python, e.g.
```python
from aurora_neware import NewareAPI

with NewareAPI() as nw:  # connect to the instrument
    nw.start(
        "pipeline_id",
        "my_sample",
        "my_protocol.xml",
    )
```

## For maintainers

To create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update --major/--minor/--patch`.
This will:

  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.
  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release.

Additional notes:

  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.
  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.
    Use the `--tag` option to override the release tag.
