# This module is responsible for the critical task of finding a target state
# node based on a target string from a reference state. It implements the full
# XState resolution logic, forming a core part of the state transition
# algorithm. Its functions are pure and have no side effects, adhering to the
# principle of Separation of Concerns.

    """Resolves a target string to a specific StateNode within the machine.

    This function implements the state resolution algorithm according to the
    standard XState specification for resolving state targets:
    1.  **Absolute**: If the target starts with '#', it's an absolute path
        from the machine root (e.g., "#machine.state.child").
    2.  **Relative**: If the target starts with '.', it's a relative path
        from the parent of the reference state (or the state itself if it's the root).
    3.  **Sibling**: Otherwise, it's treated as a sibling of the reference
        state, bubbling up through ancestors if not found immediately.

        target: The target string to resolve.
