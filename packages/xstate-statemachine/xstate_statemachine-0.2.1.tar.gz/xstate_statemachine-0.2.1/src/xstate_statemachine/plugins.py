# 🔗 Plugin Architecture
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module provides the base class for creating plugins that can hook into
# the interpreter's lifecycle. This follows the Observer and Strategy design
# patterns, allowing for a clean separation of concerns where cross-cutting
# logic like logging, debugging, or persistence can be added without modifying
# the core interpreter. This makes the system highly extensible and maintainable.
