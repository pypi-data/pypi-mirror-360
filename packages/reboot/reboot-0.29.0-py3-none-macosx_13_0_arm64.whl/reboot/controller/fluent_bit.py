Helpers for setting up Fluent Bit as a sidecar container.

Fluent Bit design notes:

* We use Fluent Bit as a sidecar container to forward logs from the main
  container to the facilitator.
* We chose Fluent Bit because we don't want to write our own log forwarding
  agent, and Fluent Bit is the industry standard.
* We chose to deploy Fluent Bit as a sidecar because it is forwards-compatible
  to Fargate, which does not support DaemonSets.
* The `fluent_bit_containers()` expect to be `initContainers` in a pod, and
  (since they set their `restartPolicy` to `Always`) they will be treated as
  "native sidecar" containers by Kubernetes; see:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/
* Being a "native sidecar" is important, because it ensures that...
    1. In combination with Istio's support for native sidecars, Fluent Bit can
       safely assume that the Istio proxy in the Pod is configured. Without this
       the Istio proxy could briefly return 404s for the facilitator, causing
       logs to be dropped.
    2. The Fluent Bit container gets its SIGTERM only after the main container
       is done, which ensures that the main container can't add logs after
       Fluent Bit has stopped forwarding.
    3. The Fluent Bit container gets its SIGTERM before the Istio proxy does,
       which ensures that Fluent Bit has the necessary network connectivity to
       flush any remaining logs.

TODO(rjh): the Fluent Bit container is still subject to the grace period set for
           the whole Pod, so it is possible that logs are dropped if for some
           reason Fluent Bit can't flush them in time. This is particularly
           something to watch out for in the case of consensus pods; config pods
           get a large grace period (30s), but consensus pods have a termination
           grace period of 0, so sidecars only get "a short grace period" [0].
           If this turns out to be a problem, we may need longer grace periods
           or a more sophisticated solution.
