# Delta Cycle

DeltaCycle is a Python library for discrete event simulation (DES).

A simulation has two components: a collection of *variables*,
and a collection of *processes*.
Variables represent the instantaneous state of the simulation.
They may be organized into arbitrary data structures.
Processes define how that state evolves.
They may appear concurrent, but are scheduled sequentially.

Process execution is subdivided into a sequence of slots.
Slots are assigned a monotonically increasing integer value, called *time*.
Multiple processes may execute in the same slot, and therefore at the same time.
The term "delta cycle" refers to a zero-delay subdivision of a time slot.
It is the clockwork mechanism behind the illusion of concurrency.

## Features

* Loop: task scheduler
* Tasks: coroutine wrapper
* Synchronization Primitives:
    * Events
    * Locks
    * Semaphores
    * Queues
* Structured concurrency:
    * Task groups
    * Task cancellation
    * Task dependencies
    * Exception handling
* Variables:
    * Singular
    * Aggregate
    * Variable dependencies

## Example

The following code simulates two clocks running concurrently.
The *fast* clock prints the current time every time step.
The *slow* clock prints the current time every two time steps.

```python
>>> from deltacycle import create_task, now, run, sleep

>>> async def clock(name: str, period: int):
...     while True:
...         print(f"{now()}: {name}")
...         await sleep(period)

>>> async def main():
...     create_task(clock("fast", 1))
...     create_task(clock("slow", 2))

>>> run(main(), until=7)
0: fast
0: slow
1: fast
2: slow
2: fast
3: fast
4: slow
4: fast
5: fast
6: slow
6: fast
```
