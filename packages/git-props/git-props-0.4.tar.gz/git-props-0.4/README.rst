Git properties
==============

A simple Python package to determine some properties from a git
repository.


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 3.6 or newer.

Required library packages:

+ `setuptools`_

+ `packaging`_

External Programs:

+ `git`_

Optional library packages:

+ `git-props`_

  This package is used to extract some metadata such as the version
  number out of git, the version control system.  All releases embed
  that metadata in the distribution.  So this package is only needed
  to build out of the plain development source tree as cloned from
  GitHub, but not to build a release distribution.

+ `pytest`_ >= 3.0

  Only needed to run the test suite.

+ `distutils-pytest`_

  Only needed to run the test suite.

+ `PyYAML`_ >= 5.1

  Only needed to run the test suite.
