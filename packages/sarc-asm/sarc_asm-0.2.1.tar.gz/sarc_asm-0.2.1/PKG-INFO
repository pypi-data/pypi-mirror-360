## Overview

SarcAsM (Sarcomere Analysis Multitool) is an AI-powered Python package for cardiomyocyte sarcomere analysis. It enables precise multilevel structural and functional assessment of sarcomeres in microscopy images and movies, making it suitable for drug screening, disease phenotyping, and biomechanical studies.

**Summary of SarcAsM workflow and analyzed features**

## Installation of Python package

### Option 1: Installation via PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to install SarcAsM is via pip:

```
pip install sarc-asm
```

### Option 2: Installation from GitHub

For the latest development version:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/danihae/sarcasm.git
```

### Setting up a dedicated environment (Recommended)

We strongly recommend creating a dedicated conda environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```
conda create -y -n sarcasm-env python=3.10
conda activate sarcasm-env
pip install sarc-asm
```

**Note:** The full installation usually takes less than 5 minutes, depending on your internet connection. For computers equipped with an NVIDIA GPU, ensure the installed PyTorch and CUDA toolkit versions are compatible. See PyTorch installation instructions for details.

## Usage

Test data for getting started can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15389034/files/test_data.zip?download=1).

### Python Package

After installation, SarcAsM can be imported and used in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks:

```
# Example workflow for structural analysis
from sarcasm import Structure, Export

# Load an image or movie
sarc = Structure("path/to/your/image_or_movie.tif")

# Detect sarcomeres
sarc.detect_sarcomeres()

# Analyze sarcomere length and orientations (sarcomere 'vectors')
sarc.analyze_sarcomere_vectors()

# Analyze Z-bands
sarc.analyze_z_bands()

# Analyze myofibrils
sarc.analyze_myofibrils()

# Analyze domains
sarc.analyze_sarcomere_domains()

# Export data to xlsx file (summary statistics of each frame, full data stored as json in file base directory)
Export.export_structure_data('/path/to/xlsx/file.xlsx', sarc_obj)
```

Check out `quickstart_demo.ipynb` in the repository root or our [documentation](https://sarcasm.readthedocs.io/)
 for a practical introduction to SarcAsM's functionalities.

### App

![SarcAsM GUI Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danihae/sarcasm/main/docs/images/SarcAsM_app.gif)

SarcAsM includes an app with intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Napari for interactive analysis and visualization.

**How to Run the App:**

There are two main ways to run the SarcAsM App:

1.  **Standalone Applications (Recommended for ease of use):**
    *   Pre-built applications for **Windows (.exe)** and **macOS (.app)** are available for download directly from the **[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/danihae/SarcAsM/releases)**.
    *   This method does not require a separate Python installation.
    *   **Note:** As mentioned in the release notes, these are early versions, and the initial startup might take some time. The Windows version currently uses CPU only.

2.  **From your Python Environment (Recommended for developers or API users):**
    *   If you have installed SarcAsM into a Python environment (e.g., via pip or conda from the source), you can launch the GUI using this command:
      ```
      # After activating your environment (e.g., conda activate sarcasm-env)
      python -m sarcasm_app
      ```
    *   Alternatively, you can run `./sarcasm_app/__main__.py` directly from the SarcAsM root directory if the necessary dependencies are in your PYTHONPATH.
