Overview
========

*bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes* provides various facilities for creation and
management of Vagrant Packer Base Boxes.

*bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes* is a python package that uses the
`PyCS-Framework <https://github.com/bisos-pip/pycs>`__ for its
implementation. It is a BISOS-Capability and a Standalone-BISOS-Package.

Much of *bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes* is based on
https://github.com/rgl/debian-vagrant but our general data driven
approach is different.

Package Documentation At Github
===============================

The information below is a subset of the full of documentation for this
bisos-pip package. More complete documentation is available at:

About vagrantBaseBoxes Data (packer base box specifications)
============================================================

*bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes* is data driven. By itself it is useless. It
operates on well structured directories which contain packer base box
specifications.

In BISOS, the packer base box specifications are in the form of a BISOS
Repo Object (BRO). The github url for the BRO is:

https://github.com/bxObjects/bro_vagrantDebianBaseBoxes

In BISOS, the defaults are:

.. code:: bash

   cd /bisos/git/bxRepos/bxObjects
   git clone https://github.com/bxObjects/bro_vagrantDebianBaseBoxes.git

You can clone that repo anywhere and then just adjust the command line
path to it.

Part of BISOS — ByStar Internet Services Operating System
=========================================================

| Layered on top of Debian, **BISOS**: (By\* Internet Services Operating
  System) is a unified and universal framework for developing both
  internet services and software-service continuums that use internet
  services. See `Bootstrapping ByStar, BISOS and
  Blee <https://github.com/bxGenesis/start>`__ for information about
  getting started with BISOS.
| **BISOS** is a foundation for **The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital
  Ecosystem** which is described as a cure for losses of autonomy and
  privacy in a book titled: `Nature of
  Polyexistentials <https://github.com/bxplpc/120033>`__

bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes as a Standalone Piece of BISOS
