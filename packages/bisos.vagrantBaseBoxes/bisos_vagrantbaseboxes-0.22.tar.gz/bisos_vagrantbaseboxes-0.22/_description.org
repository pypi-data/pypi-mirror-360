#+title: bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes: Facilities for Creating and Managing Vagrant Packer Base Boxes




* Overview

/bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes/ provides various facilities for creation and management of
Vagrant Packer Base Boxes.

/bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes/ is a python package that uses the [[https://github.com/bisos-pip/pycs][PyCS-Framework]] for its
implementation. It is a BISOS-Capability and a Standalone-BISOS-Package.

Much of /bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes/ is based on https://github.com/rgl/debian-vagrant
but our general data driven approach is different.

* About vagrantBaseBoxes Data (packer base box specifications)


/bisos.vagrantBaseBoxes/ is data driven. By itself it is useless. It operates on
well structured directories which contain packer base box specifications.

In BISOS, the packer base box specifications are in the form of a
BISOS Repo Object (BRO). The github url for the BRO is:

[[https://github.com/bxObjects/bro_vagrantDebianBaseBoxes]]

In BISOS, the defaults are:

#+begin_src bash
cd /bisos/git/bxRepos/bxObjects
git clone https://github.com/bxObjects/bro_vagrantDebianBaseBoxes.git
#+end_src

You can clone that repo anywhere and then just adjust the command line path to it.

* Part of BISOS --- ByStar Internet Services Operating System

Layered on top of Debian, *BISOS*: (By* Internet Services Operating System) is a
unified and universal framework for developing both internet services and
software-service continuums that use internet services. See [[https://github.com/bxGenesis/start][Bootstrapping
ByStar, BISOS and Blee]] for information about getting started with BISOS.\\
*BISOS* is a foundation for *The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem* which is
described as a cure for losses of autonomy and privacy in a book titled: [[https://github.com/bxplpc/120033][Nature
of Polyexistentials]]
