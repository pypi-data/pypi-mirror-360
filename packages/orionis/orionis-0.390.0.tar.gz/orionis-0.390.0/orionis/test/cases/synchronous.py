class SyncTestCase(unittest.TestCase, TestDumper):
    """
    Base test case class for synchronous unit testing.

    This class provides a foundation for writing synchronous unit tests within
    the Orionis framework. It extends unittest.TestCase and includes TestDumper
    functionality for enhanced test output and debugging capabilities.

    The class provides hooks for custom setup and teardown logic through the
    onSetup() and onTeardown() methods, which can be overridden by subclasses
    to implement test-specific initialization and cleanup procedures.

    Attributes
    ----------
    None

    Methods
    -------
    setUp()
        Initialize test environment before each test method execution.
    tearDown()
        Clean up test environment after each test method execution.
    onSetup()
        Hook method for subclass-specific setup logic.
    onTeardown()
        Hook method for subclass-specific teardown logic.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> class MyTest(SyncTestCase):
    ...     def onSetup(self):
    ...         self.data = [1, 2, 3]
    ...
    ...     def testExample(self):
    ...         self.assertEqual(len(self.data), 3)
    """

    def setUp(self):
        """
        Initialize the test environment before each test method.

        This method is automatically called by the unittest framework before
        each test method execution. It performs the standard unittest setup
        and then calls the onSetup() hook for custom initialization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None

        Notes
        -----
        This method should not be overridden directly. Use onSetup() instead
        for custom setup logic.

        super().setUp()

        This method is automatically called by the unittest framework after

        cleanup and then performs the standard unittest teardown.
