    """
    Base service provider class for the Orionis framework.

    This class serves as a base for all service providers in the application.
    Service providers are responsible for registering components and services
    into the application container, and initializing them when needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app : IContainer
        The application container instance to which services will be registered.

    Notes
    -----
    All concrete service providers should inherit from this class and implement
    the `register` method at minimum.
    """

    def __init__(self, app: IContainer) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the service provider with the application container.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app : IContainer
            The application container instance.

        Register services into the application container.

        This method must be implemented by all concrete service providers.
        It should bind services, configurations, or other components
        to the application container.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If the method is not overridden in a subclass.

        Perform any post-registration bootstrapping or initialization.

        This method is called after all services have been registered.
        Override this method to initialize services, set up event listeners,
