        Test async container dependency injection functionality.

        Validates the container's ability to resolve services in async
        contexts and manage async dependencies. This method demonstrates
        async dependency injection patterns and service resolution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        container : Application
            Injected application container instance for testing async
            dependency injection capabilities.

        Tests
        -----
        - Async service resolution from container
        - Async service method execution
        - Async dependency lifecycle management
        - Async service functionality validation

        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError
            If async container operations fail or services cannot be resolved.
