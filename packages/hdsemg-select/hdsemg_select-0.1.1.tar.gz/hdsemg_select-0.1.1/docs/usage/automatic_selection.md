## Automatic Selection

This section describes how to use the automatic selection feature in the hdsemg-select application to quickly identify and identify bad channels based on their signal characteristics.

### Purpose of Automatic Selection

The automatic selection feature is designed to help users quickly identify channels that may be faulty and might disort further Analysis Steps. This is particularly useful in HDsEMG data, where manual inspection of each channel can be time-consuming and impractical.#

### How to Use Automatic Selection

Right now, there is only one automatic selection method available, which is based on the amplitude of the signal. This method allows you to select channels that exceed a certain amplitude threshold, indicating potential issues with the signal quality.

#### Frequency-Based Selection

| 5    | Click **"Start"** to begin analyzing channels based on your thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                          |
| 6    | The application will scan all channels and automatically select those that meet the defined amplitude range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                          |
