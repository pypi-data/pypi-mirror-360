## Workflow for bug reports, feature requests and documentation improvements

Before opening an issue, please search [existing issues](https://github.com/lintquarto/lintquarto/issues/) to avoid duplicates. If there is not an existing issue, please open open and provide as much detail as possible.

* **For feature requests or documentation improvements**, please describe your suggestion clearly.
* **For bugs**, include:
    * Steps to reproduce.
    * Expected and actual behaviour.
    * Environment details (operating system, python version, dependencies).
    * Relevant files (e.g. problematic `.qmd` files).

### Handling bug reports (for maintainers):

* Confirm reproducibility by following the reported steps.
* Label the issue appropriately (e.g. `bug`).
* Request additional information if necessary.
* Link related issues or pull requests.
* One resolved, close the issue with a brief summary of the fix.

## Workflow for code contributions (bug fixes, enhancements)

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```{.bash}
git checkout -b my-feature
```

3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages using the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

4. Push your branch to your fork:

```{.bash}
git push origin my-feature
```

5. Open a pull request against the main branch. Describe your changes and reference any related issues.

## Development and testing

### Dependencies

If you want to contribute to `lintquarto` or run its tests, you'll need some additional tools:

* **flit** (for packaging and publishing)
* **genbadge** (to create a coverage badge for the README)
* **jupyter** (for running python code in documentation)
* **pytest** (for running tests)
* **pytest-cov** (to calculate coverage)
* **twine** (for uploading to PyPI)
* **quartodoc** (for generate API reference documentation)
* `-e .[all]` (an editable install of the package and all supported linters)

These are listed in `requirements-dev.txt` for convenience. To set up your development environment, run:

```{.bash}
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

There is also a testing-only environment required, as used by the testing GitHub action:

```{.bash}
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

Quarto is using for building the documentation. It is a standalone tool and must be installed separately from Python packages. You will need to download and install quarto from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/.

#### Versions

By default, contributors are encouraged to install and use the latest versions of development tools when working on the project. This approach helps keep the project compatible with current tooling and surfaces issues early.

For contributors who need a fully reproducible and stable setup, a Conda environment file is provided: `requirements-stable.yml`. This file pins all development tool versions, including Python, so you can expect consistent behaviour across systems.

To update the versions in this stable environment, run `conda update --all` and test thoroughly (running tests, building documentation), and updating the `.yml` file.

### Tests

To run tests (with coverage calculation):

```{.bash}
pytest --cov
```

### Linting

Bash scripts are provided for linting. To make them executable:

```{.bash}
chmod +x lint_package.sh
chmod +x lint_docs.sh
```

To lint package:

```{.bash}
lint_package.sh
```

To lint documentation:

```{.bash}
lint_docs.sh
```

### Documentation

To build and preview the documentation:

```{.bash}
make -C docs
```

### Updating the package

If you are a maintainer and need to publish a new release:

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md`.

2. Update the version number in `__init__.py`, `CITATION.cff` and `README.md` citation, and update the date in `CITATION.cff`.

3. Create a release on GitHub, which will automatically archive to Zenodo.

4. Build and publish using flit or twine.

To upload to PyPI using `flit`:

```{.bash}
flit publish
```

To upload to PyPI using `twine`: remove any existing builds, then build the package locally and push with twine, entering the API token when prompted:

```{.bash}
rm -rf dist/
flit build
twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

For test runs, you can use the same method with test PyPI:

```{.bash}
rm -rf dist/
flit build
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
