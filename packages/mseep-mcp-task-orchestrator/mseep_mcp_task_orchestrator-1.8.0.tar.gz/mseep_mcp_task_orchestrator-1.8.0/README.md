## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ 
- One or more MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, Windsurf, or VS Code with Cline extension)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install mcp-task-orchestrator
mcp-task-orchestrator-cli setup
# Restart your MCP client and look for 'task-orchestrator' in available tools
```

#### Option 2: Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EchoingVesper/mcp-task-orchestrator.git
cd mcp-task-orchestrator
mcp-task-orchestrator-cli check-deps  # Check and install dependencies
python run_installer.py
# Restart your MCP client and look for 'task-orchestrator' in available tools
```

#### Troubleshooting Dependencies
If you encounter import errors or missing modules:
```bash
mcp-task-orchestrator-cli check-deps
# This will check for missing dependencies and offer to install them
```

### Verification
Try this in your MCP client:
```
"Initialize a new orchestration session and plan a Python script for processing CSV files"
```

## How It Works

The orchestrator uses a five-step process:

1. **Workspace Detection** - Automatically identifies your project type and root directory
2. **Task Analysis** - LLM analyzes your request and creates structured subtasks  
3. **Task Planning** - Organizes subtasks with dependencies and complexity assessment
4. **Specialist Execution** - Each subtask runs with role-specific context and expertise
5. **Result Synthesis** - Combines outputs into a comprehensive solution with workspace-aware artifact placement

### Available Tools

**NEW in v1.8.0**: Workspace paradigm automatically detects your project root and creates `.task_orchestrator` files in the appropriate location. No manual directory specification needed!

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|------|---------|------------|
| `orchestrator_initialize_session` | Start new workflow | `working_directory` (optional) |

## Configuration & Customization

The installer handles configuration automatically. For manual setup, see [`docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md`](docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md).

### Custom Specialist Roles

Create project-specific specialists by editing `.task_orchestrator/roles/project_roles.yaml`:

```yaml
security_auditor:
  role_definition: "You are a Security Analysis Specialist"
  expertise:
    - "OWASP security standards"
    - "Penetration testing methodologies"  
    - "Secure coding practices"
  approach:
    - "Focus on security implications"
    - "Identify potential vulnerabilities"
    - "Ensure compliance with security standards"
```

The file is automatically created when you start a new orchestration session in any directory.

## Common Use Cases

**Software Development**: Full-stack web applications, API development with testing, database schema design, DevOps pipeline setup

**Data Science**: Machine learning pipelines, data analysis workflows, research project planning, model deployment strategies

**Documentation & Content**: Technical documentation, code review and refactoring, testing strategy development, content creation workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No MCP clients detected"** - Ensure at least one supported client is installed and run it once before installation

**"Configuration failed"** - Check file permissions, try running installer as administrator/sudo

**"Module not found errors"** - Delete `venv_mcp` folder and reinstall: `rm -rf venv_mcp && python run_installer.py`

### Diagnostic Tools

```bash
python scripts/diagnostics/check_status.py        # System health check
python scripts/diagnostics/diagnose_db.py         # Database optimization  
python scripts/diagnostics/verify_tools.py        # Installation verification
```

## Testing & Development

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

The MCP Task Orchestrator now includes robust testing improvements that eliminate common issues:

- **✅ No Output Truncation**: File-based output system prevents test output truncation
- **✅ No Resource Warnings**: Proper database connection management eliminates ResourceWarnings  
- **✅ No Test Hanging**: Comprehensive hang detection and timeout mechanisms
- **✅ Alternative Test Runners**: Bypass pytest limitations with specialized runners

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Activate environment
source venv_mcp/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv_mcp\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Run enhanced testing suite
python tests/test_resource_cleanup.py     # Validate resource management
python tests/test_hang_detection.py       # Test hang prevention systems
python tests/enhanced_migration_test.py   # Run migration test with full output

# Demonstrate improved testing features
python tests/demo_file_output_system.py   # Show file-based output system
python tests/demo_alternative_runners.py  # Show alternative test runners

# Traditional pytest (still supported)
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Testing Best Practices

For reliable test execution, use the new testing infrastructure:

```python
# File-based output (prevents truncation)
from mcp_task_orchestrator.testing import TestOutputWriter
writer = TestOutputWriter(output_dir)
with writer.write_test_output("my_test", "text") as session:
    session.write_line("Test output here...")

# Alternative test runners (more reliable than pytest)
from mcp_task_orchestrator.testing import DirectFunctionRunner
runner = DirectFunctionRunner(output_dir=Path("outputs"))
result = runner.execute_test(my_test_function, "test_name")

# Database connections (prevents resource warnings)
from tests.utils.db_test_utils import managed_sqlite_connection
with managed_sqlite_connection("test.db") as conn:
    # Database operations with guaranteed cleanup
    pass
```
