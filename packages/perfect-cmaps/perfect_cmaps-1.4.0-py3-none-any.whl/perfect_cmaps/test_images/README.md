### Example images for testing colormaps compared with greyscale

Big thanks to Nanoscience.com for letting me use these images as examples!
Check them out and find the images, along with a description of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and info about their products, at https://www.nanoscience.com/techniques/scanning-electron-microscopy/.

The image `colourmaptest.tif` by Peter KÃ¶vesi is useful for controlling perceptual uniformity in colormaps. None of the stripes in the image should disappear if the colormap is perceptually uniform.
