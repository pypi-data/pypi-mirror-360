<p>Statistics are shown on an unlimited basis, i.e.Â assuming unlimited
InsCo assets.</p>

<p>New business is more volatile than reserves because it allows for
uncertainty in claim occurrence as well as ultimate payment amount. In
practice a prospective book may have an estimated CV between 20 and 40
percent. Reserves often have estimated CVs below 10 percent.</p>

<p>The objective and market values track from . The Difference column is
the difference between Market and Objective, which corresponds to the
risk margin. Equity increases from statutory to objective because of
limited liability, but decreases to market because of risk margins. The
latter are far more material than the former for a well capitalized
company, so there is a more material difference between Market and
Objective equity than between Objective and Statutory.</p>
