<h3 id="set-up-and-standing-assumptions">Set Up and Standing
Assumptions</h3>

<p>Up to this point InsCo has been a one period entity, created <em>de
novo</em> at the beginning of the period and extinguished at the end.
Now extend this concept by allowing InsCo to carry forward reserve
liabilities and supporting assets from business written in prior
periods. At the beginning of each new period InsCo has the option of
continuing as a going-concern and writing new business, or becoming a
run-off entity. This section analyzes InsCo’s decision.</p>

<p>Reserves are an evaluation of claim liabilities at a point in time
before final settlement. Simultaneously with reserve evaluations InsCo
must pass accounting solvency and regulatory capital tests. Introducing
reserves is inextricably linked with a notion of <em>time</em>: when and
how frequently are reserves, solvency and capital evaluated? Until now
there has been no explicit notion of time in the analysis. The
distortion function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> introduced in
Ch. 4 prices a bond with a probability <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> of default over one time period. In a
multi-period model <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> will need to
be applied multiple times in order to determine the risk load to
ultimate.</p>

<p>The ability to avoid specifying the length of a period has been
enabled by the assumption of a zero risk free rate of interest. Since
interest represents a rate of payment per unit of time it also requires
an explicit temporal framework. The analysis will continue to assume a
zero risk free rate.</p>

<p>In a one period model, where losses are paid at the end of the
period, it is clear that a risk measure must apply to the paid loss
random variable. In a multi-period model there are different ways to
define which variable should be used to evaluate risk. In Solvency II
the capital standard is applied to the end of period market value of
liabilities. Since there isn’t a market value for most insurance
liabilities, this quantity is estimated as reserves plus a risk margin
that is calculated as the cost of capital times regulatory capital over
the run-off period. The UK (England REF) requires risk be evaluated
using ultimate variability at each point in time. Since the sum of one
year views must reconcile to ultimate risk in a steady state book these
two must be approximately equal, albeit with the option to push
recognized volatility into the future in Solvency II.</p>

<p>The examples in this section assume that the regulator uses the
ultimate distribution of losses at each point in time when evaluating
risk. This view is consistent with the fact that InsCo has an option not
to re-capitalize to the regulator standard at each evaluation point. It
also reflects the inherent difficulties in modeling a future
distribution of market values. The extent it possibly over-states risk
can be offset by selecting a lower probability threshold in the
regulator risk measure.</p>

<p>Specifically, the regulatory and valuation assumptions are as
follows.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>All risky liabilities have a fair market price given by the
distortion <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and associated risk
measure <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, per Ch2. 4 and 9. The
market value of a risk <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, whether
paid or booked as a liability at the end of the period, is <span
class="math inline">\(\rho(X)=\int g(S(t))\,dt\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a sum of parts then there is a
natural allocation to each part, REF. As a result of this assumption
InsCo faces costly capital. Previously the analysis considered risky
cash flow rather than risky liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulation requires InsCo holds <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{VaR}\)</span> capital based on the
<em>objective</em> distribution of <em>ultimate</em> loss. The
calculation uses expected value, reflecting the full range of outcomes,
and with a reduction for claims paying ability. It is MAYBE consistent
with the UK but not Solvency II. If InsCo fails the capital standard the
regulator can place it into rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
i.e. existing management is usurped. The example takes <span
class="math inline">\(p={{p}}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are three accounting views: statutory, objective and
economic that differ in how they value liabilities.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Statutory</strong> accounting takes an objective point
estimate and does not reduce payments to reflect available assets. It
proxies US statutory and GAAP accounting.</li>
<li><strong>Objective</strong> accounting follows the capital standard:
it uses expected value against objective probabilities, reflecting the
full range of outcomes, and with a reduction for claims paying
ability.</li>
<li>Market accounting takes market value of liabilities. It differs from
objective accounting by using risk adjusted probabilities, which produce
an explicit risk load. Market accounting proxies IFRS.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>There is no difference in the carrying value of an asset across
the three accounting views. All assets are invested in a risk free
instrument, the numeraire, that pays a zero interest rate. The market
value of an asset always remains equal to its original statement
value.</p></li>
<li><p>Liability holders have equal priority in default.</p></li>
<li><p>All policies have the same effective date and a one period policy
term. There is no unearned premium reserve at the end of a period. The
only liability carried forward is an unpaid loss reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>Capital markets are efficient and InsCo investors do not have a
liquidity constraint.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to solvency regulation InsCo also faces standard
financial accounting thresholds. If its assets fall below the financial
reporting expected value of liabilities it becomes insolvent and goes
into liquidation. Since this is a weaker test than the capital standard
it never becomes part of the analysis.</p>

<p>As a matter of nomenclature, <em>new business</em> refers to policies
that are written and become effective during a period. It encompasses
both renewals of existing policies and new-new policies. The model is
not addressing questions of new-new business performing differently than
renewal business.</p>

<p>In the example the reserves and new business are independent for
computational convenience. However, the calculus does not require
independence.</p>

<p>If expected payments from reserves plus new business equals the
amount of new business written then the portfolio is in steady state.
However, this is not necessary. Paid losses are only relevant to
determine the probability of different decisions, and are not included
in the model until the last section.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(X_{0}\)</span> represents business
written in the first period from <span
class="math inline">\(\tau=0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\tau=1\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(X_{-1}\)</span> represents business written in the
prior period from <span class="math inline">\(\tau=-1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\tau=0\)</span>. As usual <span
class="math inline">\(X=X_{-1}+X_{0}\)</span> is total liabilities and
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> represents assets.</p>

<p>The <strong>market value</strong> of InsCo defined as the market
value of assets less market value of liabilities. Since assets are held
at market value in a risk free account it is simply <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{MV}(X, a) = a - \rho(X\wedge a)\)</span>.
The economic gain or loss for investors from a change to InsCo assets or
liabilities is defined as the change in market value minus the change in
assets invested. If there is a change <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(X&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(a&#39;\)</span> then it is given by <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
EGL
&amp;= (a&#39;-\rho(X&#39;\wedge a&#39;))- (a-\rho(X\wedge a))
-(a&#39;-a) \nonumber \\
&amp;= \rho(X\wedge a) - \rho(X&#39;\wedge a&#39;). \label{eq:egl}
\end{align}\]</span> Changes in economics are driven solely by their
impact on insured claim liabilities. An economic gain or loss for
investors is exactly offset by an economic loss or gain for
insureds.</p>

<p>The simple form of relies on the fact assets are invested in a risk
free instrument so <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does not
change from its initial value. It also relies on there being no
frictional costs to investors of holding assets within InsCo. With asset
risk or frictional costs there could a loss of value immediately on
investment. Practitioners speak of insurers as capital roach motels:
capital can check-in but it can never check out. We are assuming an
efficient capital market without such frictions.</p>

<p>The economic gain or loss from a small change <span
class="math inline">\(da\)</span> in assets with no change in
liabilities, i.e. an increase in capital, is <span
class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\mathit{EGL} = \int_0^a g(S(t))dt - \int_0^{a&#39;} g(S(t))dt =
-g(S(a))da &lt; 0. \label{eq:never-recap}
\end{equation}\]</span> by . Investors will <em>never</em> voluntarily
add assets to InsCo with no change in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> because it is a gift to insureds. On
the other hand they will <em>always</em> benefit from decreasing assets,
but insureds will never voluntarily submit to such a reduction. Here
there is a critical distinction between new business and reserves: new
business has a choice of insurer in a competitive market whereas
claimant liability holders, <em>reserve holders</em>, are locked into
InsCo. In a transparent market it is not possible to extract excess
profits, beyond the cost of capital, from new business because insureds
would not purchase at a price above the fair market value. However, it
is possible to do so from reserve holders because they are unable to
unilaterally move their claim to another insurer. The insurer has
latitude to change capitalization for claimants provided it complies
with regulation. In particular it has the right to dividend excess
capital, above the regulator standard, to owners resulting in a transfer
of market value from reserve holders to shareholder owners. Extracting
this value creates an incentive for InsCo to continue as a
going-concern.</p>

{{ margin_earned | safe }}

<p>Table: Margin is earned in each period is determined by the natural
allocation. Beginning margin shows cumulative margin available at each
point in time.</p>

<p> shows how economic income is earned. The difference in margin with
the following period is earned during the period. The bulk of the margin
is earned in the first period, as expected. It has the greatest
resolution of uncertainty. This is particularly true for short-tailed,
catastrophe exposed lines. Removing the claim count uncertainty has a
relatively small impact. Setting up accurate case reserves will be
important. Obviously the more accurate case reserves the less
uncertainty and margin is deferred into period 4 when claims are paid.
At <span class="math inline">\(t=4\)</span> all claims are paid and
closed. In steady state the total margin earned equals the margin
embedded in the current accident year.</p>

<p>In this case reserve duration is exactly four years. There are no
payments made before then. The risk tenor, defined as the ratio of
cumulative beginning period margins to one year margin is
{{risk_tenor}}.</p>

<p>In run-off the margin required for the reserves at best estimate is
{{best_estimate_margin}} vs. {{going_concern_margin}} as a
going-concern.</p>

<p>The column header shows assets <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
carried forward by InsCo to back the reserve liability at the end of the
prior period. The table shows a range of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> around the required run-off asset level
<span
class="math inline">\(a_{ro}:=\mathit{VaR}_{p}(X_{-1})={{a_x0}}\)</span>.
The last column shows the going-concern capital <span

including <span class="math inline">\(X_{0}\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(\rho(X_{-1}\wedge a)\)</span> is run-off premium.
<span class="math inline">\(P(X_{-1}(a))\)</span> is the natural
allocation going-concern market value premium for <span
class="math inline">\(X_{-1}\)</span> as part of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(\rho(X\wedge a)\)</span> is total premium as a
going-concern. All premiums are computed with the same distortion but
generally with different <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>-measures
between the run-off and run-off scenarios. The market value of insurance
payments reflects actual assets, whereas financial accounting reserve
expectations may not.
<!-- Thus the market value of InsCo is greater than its accounting value. It has a price to book ratio greater than 1. --></p>

<p>InsCo’s market value can be computed on a run-off basis, with
liabilities <span class="math inline">\(X_{-1}\)</span>, or on a
going-concern basis, with liabilities <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\mathit{MV}\)</span> represents the change
in market value from a strategic decision.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta Q(a)\)</span> represents capital
cash calls or dividends paid to owners as the result of strategic
decisions made about renewal and run-off. A positive value represents a
capital injection, required to maintain the minimum capital level, and a
negative value corresponds to a dividend payable to owners to lower
excess capital to the regulated level. InsCo faces costly capital and
will never hold more than the regulator required level.</p>

<p>Going into the new period InsCo has two options.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Enter run-off, adding no new premium.
<ol type="a">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;a_{ro}\)</span>, InsCo would be
subject to some level of regulatory supervision unless it re-capitalized
to the regulatory level. If <span
class="math inline">\(a&lt;E[X_{-1}]\)</span> InsCo is technically
insolvent and could be forced into rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation by the regulator without management action. This case is not
considered separately.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(a&gt;a_{ro}\)</span> then InsCo can
dividend excess capital back to owners and reconsider its options.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Continue as a going-concern, writing new business, <span
class="math inline">\(X_{0}\)</span>. It is subject to minimum capital
requirements and must re-capitalize to <span
class="math inline">\(a_{gc}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to decide between these options InsCo computes the economic
gain or loss from each and selects the one with the greatest
<em>EGL</em> provided it is positive. If <em>EGL</em> is negative for
all options the company enters run-off and accepts regulatory strictures
associated with failing the capital standard.</p>

<p>In reality InsCo would have a range of new business it could write.
It would select the one with the greatest positive <em>EGL</em> by
repeating the following analysis for each.</p>

<p>This process mirrors a Lloyd’s reinsurance to close transaction,
where one year of account is reinsured into a new syndicate.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="case-1-run-off">Case 1: Run-Off</h4>
<p>In run-off, InsCo requires assets <span
class="math inline">\(a_{ro}\)</span> and owners face a call (dividend
if <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0\)</span>) of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta Q_{ro}(a) = a-a_{ro}\)</span> to
re-capitalize (return excess capital). It is relatively unlikely that
assets are inadequate and investors face a call, see the left two
columns of . The third column corresponds to assets exactly equal to
<span class="math inline">\(a_{ro}\)</span> and so there is no capital
adjustment. In all columns to the right they receive a dividend.</p>

<p>When it takes no action, InsCo has a run-off market value of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{MV}_{ro}(a) = a-\rho(X_{-1}\wedge
a)\)</span>. If ending assets are low relative to unlimited liabilities
the market value is very small, but it is always positive unless <span
class="math inline">\(\Pr(X_{-1}&lt;a_{ro})=0\)</span>, i.e. if the
owner’s residual value is certain to be zero. If InsCo re-capitalizes
the market value becomes <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{MV}_{ro}(a_{ro})\)</span>. Owners will
decide to re-capitalize if there is a positive economic gain or loss
from their investment <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{EGL}_{ro}(a)=P(X_{-1}\wedge a) -
\rho(X_{-1}\wedge a_{ro}) \ge 0\)</span>.</p>

<p>As we have already seen in re-capitalizing with no change to
liabilities will alway destroy market value. Adding capital is a
donation to claimants, increasing the value of their claim and
destroying investor value. For asset values close to <span
class="math inline">\(a_{ro}\)</span> the loss is quite small, but it
increases rapidly for lower asset levels. An investment could still be
undertaken to avoid costs of financial distress generated by regulator
supervision, where investor appointed managers are replaced with
regulator appointees who may have non-commercial incentives but these
considerations are outside the model.</p>

<p>In case 1.b, where ending assets <span
class="math inline">\(a&gt;a_{ro}\)</span>, InsCo can dividend excess
capital back to owners and become a run-off entity. Again, in the
absence of other reasons, it will always choose do so. Extenuating
reasons could include reputation and marketing benefits or if InsCo
faces inefficient capital markets for raising new capital under
financial distress. Higher premium for a more well capitalized company
is <strong>not</strong> a reason because premiums already explicitly
incorporate capital adequacy.</p>

<p>InsCo can also consider going-concern options.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="case-2-going-concern">Case 2:
Going-Concern</h4>
<p>As a going-concern InsCo requires assets <span
class="math inline">\(a_{gc}\)</span>, which will typically be larger
than <span class="math inline">\(a_{ro}\)</span> by at least the volume
of new business written. The new assets will come from two sources:
premium from new business and a capital contribution from current
investors. Existing investors pay the fair market premium for <span
class="math inline">\(X_{-1}\)</span>, combine it with <span
class="math inline">\(X_{0}\)</span>, add assets to the regulated level,
and collect new premium. They create an entity with a higher market
value which they could sell to recoup their investment if desired. They
will undertake the investment if the increase in market value it
produces is greater than the amount of their investment.</p>

<p>Since the capital market is efficient there is no need to distinguish
between new and existing investors. Existing investors engineer InsCo so
it can write <span class="math inline">\(X_{-1}+X_{0}\)</span> and then
sell it or retain it. Or InsCo owners can bring on new investors by
selling a pro rata portion of the going-concern. Or new investors can be
brought in <em>pari passu</em> with existing owners during the
transaction. In an efficient market there are no liquidity constraints
and the order of these transactions is irrelevant. Owners will be able
to obtain the necessary financing to re-capitalize and sell if doing so
creates market value. Since all valuation is at the fair market price
there is no dilution between new and existing investors. The model does
not allow imperfections such as a control premium or asymmetric
information between management, existing and new investors, for
example.</p>

<p>Adding <span class="math inline">\(X_{0}\)</span> results in total
liabilities <span class="math inline">\(X=X_{-1}+X_{0}\)</span> and
regulatory asset level <span class="math inline">\(a_{gc}\)</span>. The
natural allocation gives the fair market value of insurance cash flows,
i.e. premium, <span class="math inline">\(P(X_i(a_{gc}))\)</span> for
each line. The new entity has market value <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{MV}_{gc}(a_{gc})=a_{gc}-\rho(X\wedge
a_{gc})={{mv_gc}}\)</span>, shown in the right-hand most column. Note
this single market value is computed for <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, as opposed to run-off <span
class="math inline">\(X_{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>To be fair to new insureds InsCo must bring forward assets equal to
the market value of assumed reserve liabilities, <span
class="math inline">\(P(X_{-1}(a_{gc}))\)</span>, and increase capital.
<span class="math inline">\(P(X_{-1}(a_{gc}))\)</span> is same market
value that would apply if new business with a distribution <span
class="math inline">\(X_{-1}\)</span> were written alongside <span
class="math inline">\(X_{0}\)</span>. InsCo owners invest <span

reserves supported by ending assets and the market value of reserves
supported by regulatory capital within a portfolio with new business.
The gain from the investment exactly equals the loss in market value to
claimants caused by a relative reduction in their capital adequacy. In
general the term on the right is positive. InsCo investors make the
investment to create the going-concern if <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{EGL}_{gc}(a)&gt;\max(0,
\mathit{EGL}_{ro}(a))\)</span>: i.e. if it is positive and is a better
option than going into run-off. In this case the break-even asset level
is <span class="math inline">\(a={{break_even}}\)</span> and
going-concern dominates run-off.</p>

<p>Comparing the going-concern and run-off <em>EGL</em>s shows they both
have the same form: market value of reserve liabilities with current
assets minus market value with regulated assets. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{gather*}
\mathit{EGL}_{ro}(a) = \rho(X_{-1}\wedge a) - \rho(X_{-1}\wedge a_{ro})
\\
\mathit{EGL}_{gc}(a) = \rho(X_{-1}\wedge a) - P(X_{-1}(a_{sa})) \\
a_{ro} &lt; a &lt; a_{gc}  \\
{{a_x0}} &lt; {{est_ye_assets}} &lt; {{a_x}} \\
P(X_{-1}(a_{gc})) &lt; \rho(X_{-1}\wedge a_{ro}) &lt; \rho(X_{-1}\wedge
a) \\
{{mvp_gc}} &lt; {{mvp_ro}} &lt; {{mvp_a}}
\end{gather*}\]</span> The last four lines show the normal ordering of
these variables in a steady state when paid losses are close to the
expected value and reserves are less volatile than new business The
relevant values are pulled from the Results table.</p>

<p>In run-off, the re-capitalizing <em>EGL</em> is positive only if it
results in a dividend because assets are greater than regulated assets.
This is likely to occur be because starting assets are calibrated to the
more volatile going-concern book. By continuing as a going-concern InsCo
captures the efficiencies of pooling reserves with new business, and so
<span class="math inline">\(P(X_{-1}(a_{gc}))={{mvp_gc}}\)</span> is
generally less than <span class="math inline">\(\rho(X_{-1}\wedge
a_{ro})={{mvp_ro}}\)</span>. The lower value in the going-concern is
driven by the claims from higher volatility new business eroding the
claimants’ position. The dynamics are illustrated in . Thus under normal
circumstances the company will continue as a going-concern. Ending
assets below {{break_even}} will put the company into run-off but this
implies very high paid loss for the year.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Market value of reserve holder claims in
a run-off and going-concern entity. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In both run-off and going-concern InsCo reduces the value of the
reserve holder claims by reducing assets to the regulatory amount: a
regulator-sanctioned haircut for claimants. Since the reserve holders
are tied into InsCo they have no recourse. The analogous action for
newly written business is impossible: it corresponds to switch-and-bait,
selling at a premium corresponding to a higher asset level and
delivering a lower one. If InsCo attempted that it would fail to write
the business. <!-- Duplication but OK? Important point --></p>

<h3 id="timing-issues-and-comparison-with-solvency-ii">Timing Issues and
Comparison with Solvency II</h3>
<p>There are some important timing differences in timing and the modeled
quantities in the model presented here and Solvency II.</p>

<p>Solvency II capital is calculated as the value at risk of one year
market values. It requires estimating the distribution of reserves book
one year out, i.e. modeling a variable with no objectively determined
value, an obvious problem.</p>

<p>The approach here uses an estimate of the distribution of ultimate
payments from current reserves, which is an objective quantity. It
implicitly relies on the distribution of paid losses during the year,
another objective quantity that can be modeled. Paid losses relate to a
specific time frame.</p>
