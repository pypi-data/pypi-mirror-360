# Python Advent of Code üéÑ

A Python CLI and library for interacting with the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) API.

## Key Features

- üåê Opens the daily puzzle page in your browser
- üöÄ Downloads your personalised puzzle inputs
- üìÇ Generates new solution files from a template
- ‚úÖ Tests and directly submits your solutions

## Installation

To use the project, you can simply install it using `pip`:

```sh
pip install python-aoc
```

It can then be used in the command line and imported as a library with `pyaoc`.

## Configuration

To interact with the Advent of Code API, you must provide your session token. This tool reads the token from an environment variable named `AOC_SESSION`, which can be set manually or through the following command:

```sh
pyaoc session set <your-session-token>
```

## Quick Start

The most common workflow is to create, test, and submit a solution.

1. **Create the files for a new day**:

   The following command will create a `day-5/` directory, download the input into `day-5/input.txt`, create a `day-5/test.txt` file to hold a test input, and create a `day-5/main.py` script file from the default `python-aoc` template:

   ```sh
   pyaoc create 5 2025
   ```

2. **Test your solution against a known answer**:

   Once you have completed your solution to the puzzle, written in a `solve` function which takes in the path to an input file, you can test it against a known answer for an example case in `test.txt`:

   ```sh
   # Assuming the example answer is 123
   pyaoc test day-5/main.py 123 --test-input-path day-5/test.txt
   ```

3. **Submit your final solution**:

   Then, the final solution for the specified part can be submitted using the `submit` command:

   ```sh
   pyaoc submit day-5/main.py 1 --day 5 --year 2025 --input-path day-5/input.txt
   ```

For the complete list of CLI commands and their arguments, run `pyaoc --help`.

## Library usage

You can also import and use the core functions in your own Python scripts:

```py
import pyaoc

# Sets the session token (if it's not already set as an environment variable)
pyaoc.set_session("your-session-token")

try:
    # Get puzzle input for Dec 1, 2023
    puzzle_input = pyaoc.get_day_input(day=1, year=2023)
    print(puzzle_input[:50]) # Print the first 50 characters
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
