"""
U-statistics to V-statistics conversion utilities.

This module provides functions for generating set partitions, encoding partitions,
and computing partition weights. These utilities are essential for converting
U-statistics to V-statistics through the analysis of partition structures.

The main functionality includes:
- Generation of all possible set partitions with specified number of parts
- Generation of non-connected partitions based on adjacency constraints
- Encoding partitions into string representations
- Computing Möbius function weights for partition lattices
