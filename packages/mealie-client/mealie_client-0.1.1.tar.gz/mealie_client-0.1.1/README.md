An unofficial Python SDK for [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) - a self-hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend.

## üöÄ Features

- **Asynchronous API Client**: Built with `httpx` for high-performance async operations
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with `pydantic` models for all API responses
- **Core Endpoints Supported**: Recipes, Users, Groups, Meal Plans, and Shopping Lists
- **Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication and username/password login
- **Recipe Management**: Full CRUD operations, search, filtering, and image management
- **Meal Planning**: Create and manage meal plans with date filtering
- **Shopping Lists**: Complete shopping list and item management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- **Modern Python**: Support for Python 3.8+ with modern async/await patterns

## üìà Current API Coverage

This SDK currently covers the following Mealie API endpoints:

‚úÖ **Recipes** - Create, read, update, delete, search, image upload, import from URL  
‚úÖ **Users** - User management and current user info  
‚úÖ **Groups** - Basic group operations  
‚úÖ **Meal Plans** - Meal planning with date filtering  
‚úÖ **Shopping Lists** - Shopping lists and item management

## üì¶ Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install mealie-client
```

### Using PDM (recommended for development)

```bash
pdm add mealie-client
```

### Using Poetry

```bash
poetry add mealie-client
```

## üèÅ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from mealie_client import MealieClient

async def main():
    # Initialize the client
    async with MealieClient(
        base_url="https://your-mealie-instance.com",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    ) as client:
        
        # Get all recipes
        recipes = await client.recipes.get_all()
        print(f"Found {len(recipes)} recipes")
        
        # Get a specific recipe
        recipe = await client.recipes.get("recipe-slug-or-id")
        if recipe:
            print(f"Recipe: {recipe.name}")
            print(f"Description: {recipe.description}")
        
        # Create a new recipe
        new_recipe = await client.recipes.create({
            "name": "Test Recipe",
            "description": "A test recipe created via SDK",
            "recipe_ingredient": [
                {"note": "2 cups flour"},
                {"note": "1 cup sugar"}
            ],
            "recipe_instructions": [
                {"text": "Mix flour and sugar"},
                {"text": "Bake at 350¬∞F for 30 minutes"}
            ]
        })
        
        print(f"Created recipe: {new_recipe.name}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Authentication

The SDK supports both API token and username/password authentication:

#### API Token Authentication (Recommended)

```python
from mealie_client import MealieClient

# Using API token
async with MealieClient(
    base_url="https://your-mealie-instance.com",
    api_token="your-long-lived-api-token"
) as client:
    recipes = await client.recipes.get_all()
```

#### Username/Password Authentication

```python
from mealie_client import MealieClient

# Using username/password
async with MealieClient(
    base_url="https://your-mealie-instance.com",
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password"
) as client:
    recipes = await client.recipes.get_all()
```

#### Environment Variables

```python
# Set environment variables
# MEALIE_USERNAME=your_username
# MEALIE_PASSWORD=your_password
# MEALIE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

from mealie_client import MealieClient

client = MealieClient.from_env("https://your-mealie-instance.com")
```

## üìñ Usage Examples
