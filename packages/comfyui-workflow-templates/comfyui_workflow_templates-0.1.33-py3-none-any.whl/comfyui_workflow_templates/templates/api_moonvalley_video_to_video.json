        "A powerful white stallion gallops gracefully across a desolate lunar surface in a stunning black and white shot. As it moves with incredible speed, its luminous mane and tail flow wildly behind it, contrasting sharply with the absolute darkness of space. Its hooves pound silently on the gray, dusty ground, kicking up plumes of fine regolith that catch the light. The camera tracks alongside the magnificent creature, creating a motion blur in the foreground that emphasizes its relentless, majestic pace through the silent, alien landscape. Background: The dark, starless black void of deep space stretches into infinity behind the scene, with distant, barren lunar mountains visible. Middleground: The brilliant white horse is captured mid-stride, its powerful muscles rippling as it runs across a cratered lunar plain. Foreground: The lunar surface is a motion blur of gray dust and rocks, with the shadow of the horse stretching out as it speeds by. ",
