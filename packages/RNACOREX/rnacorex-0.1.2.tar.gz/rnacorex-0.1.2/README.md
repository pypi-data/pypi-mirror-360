# RNACOREX

**RNACOREX** is a Python package for building Bayesian Network based classification models using miRNA-mRNA post-transcriptional networks. It uses curated interaction databases and conditional mutual information for identifying sets of interactions and model them using Conditional Linear Gaussian Classifiers (CLGs).

## ðŸš€ Features

- Extracts structural and functional scores from miRNA-mRNA interactions.
- Identify sets of interactions associated to different phenotypes.
- Build CLG classifiers with the sets of interactions.
- Display the post-transcriptional networks.
