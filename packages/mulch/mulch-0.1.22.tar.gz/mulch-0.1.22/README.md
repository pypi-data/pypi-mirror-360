# mulch â€” Workspace Factory CLI

`mulch` is a lightweight, project-agnostic CLI tool to scaffold and generate workspace directories
for any Python project. It bootstraps a standardized workspace folder structure and configuration
files inside your project directory.

---

## Features

- Initialize workspaces with a consistent scaffold defined by `scaffold.json`
- Create a `default-workspace.toml` to track the active workspace
- Works standalone and project-agnostic; no assumptions about your repo layout
- Easily installable and runnable via `pipx`
