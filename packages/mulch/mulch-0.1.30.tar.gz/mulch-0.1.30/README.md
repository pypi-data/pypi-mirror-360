# mulch â€” Workspace Factory CLI

`mulch` is a lightweight, project-agnostic CLI tool to scaffold and generate workspace directories
for any Python project. It bootstraps a standardized workspace folder structure and configuration
files inside your project directory.

Set up new projects easily with workspace scaffolding and source-code templating. Key feature: Benefit from introspective directory geters and file getters in the workspace_manager.py file in src, dictated by mulch-scaffold.json and protected by mulch.lock.
---

## Features

- Initialize workspaces with a consistent scaffold defined by `mulch-scaffold.json`
- Create a `default-workspace.toml` to track the active workspace
- Works standalone and project-agnostic; no assumptions about your repo layout
- Easily installable and runnable via `pipx`

mulch file

# Initialize workspace named 'default' in the current directory

mulch init ./myproject --name workspace1

# Initialize workspace named 'workspace1' in the current directory
mulch init --name workspace1

# Skip creating default-workspace.toml
mulch init ./myproject --name workspace1 --no-set-default
```
