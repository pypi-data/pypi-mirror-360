## Serialising Unique Numeric Identifiers

It is helpful to have a simple, machine readable unique integer number to identify
a piece of equipment of a given abbreviation, as [described here by BDNS](https://theodi.github.io/BDNS/BDNS_Specification_naming_syntax.html#format-2). Given that in BDNS-plus other fields which identify
a specific instance of equipment are defined; it is possible to generate a unique id from these fields.
