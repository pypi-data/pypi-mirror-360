    harmonic of the original signal. SFDR is an important specification in
    communications systems because it represents the smallest value of signal
    that can be distinguished from a large interfering signal (blocker). SFDR
    is specified here w.r.t. an actual signal amplitude (dBc). Thus, it's expected
    that the given signal vector `x` has some main frequency component greater than
    any spurs present in the spectrum to return a sensible value.

    the value for noise used in the SNR calculation is the noise that extends
    over the entire Nyquist bandwidth (DC to $f_{s}/2$), but the FFT acts as a
    narrowband spectrum analyzer with a bandwidth of $f_{s}/M$ that sweeps over the
    spectrum. This has the effect of pushing the noise down by an amount equal
    to the process gainâ€” the same effect as narrowing the bandwidth of an analog
    spectrum analyzer. Thus to find the "real" RMS noise level (which is affected
    by quantization, system or environmental noise), subtract the measured FFT noise
    floor by this processing gain value.
