CxiPerfStats,^HNI_TX_PAUSED_\d+$,Number of cycles in which the transmit path is paused for traffic class <n>; default classes are 0 for request and 1 for response. Indicates that this endpoint is supplying data faster than the network can deliver it. Divide by 1E9 to determine the proportion of time paused.
CxiPerfStats,^HNI_RX_PAUSED_\d+$,Number of cycles in which the pause is applied on the receive path for traffic class <n>; default classes are 0 for request and 1 for response. Indicates that the network is supplying data faster than this endpoint can consume it. Divide by 1E9 to determine the proportion of time paused.

CxiPerfStats,^PARBS_TARB_PI_POSTED_BLOCKED_CNT$,and the number of cycles in which this path is blocked. Compute the ratio cycles/pkts. Values of more than a few cycles per packet indicate back pressure from the host. This endpoint is likely to be the cause of congestion.
