# DEBase Examples

This directory contains example outputs and usage demonstrations for the DEBase pipeline.

## Example Outputs

The `../../examples/` directory contains sample results from successful pipeline runs:

- `trpb_complete_pipeline.csv` - Complete TrpB enzyme dataset with sequences, mutations, and reactions
- `carbene_complete_pipeline.csv` - Carbene transfer enzyme data with SMILES and conditions  
- `REFINED_ENZYME_SEQUENCES.csv` - Refined sequence extraction results

## Data Format

Each CSV contains:
- Full-length protein sequences (200-400+ amino acids)
- Complete mutation lineage tracking
- Chemical reaction SMILES strings
- Experimental conditions and metadata
- Performance metrics (yield, TTN, enantioselectivity)

## Usage

These files demonstrate the expected output format and can be used as reference for pipeline validation.
