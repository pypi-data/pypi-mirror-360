# ⚡ Dispytch

**Dispytch** is a lightweight, async-first Python framework for event-handling.
It’s designed to streamline the development of clean and testable event-driven services.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **Async-first core** – built for modern Python I/O
* 🔌 **FastAPI-style dependency injection** – clean, decoupled handlers
* 🔁 **Built-in retry logic** – configurable, resilient, no boilerplate
* 📬 **Backend-flexible** – Kafka and RabbitMQ out-of-the-box
* 🧱 **Composable architecture** – extend, override, or inject anything

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install dispytch
```

## ✨ Handler example

```python
from typing import Annotated

from pydantic import BaseModel
from dispytch import Event, Dependency, HandlerGroup

from service import UserService, get_user_service


class User(BaseModel):
    id: str
    email: str
    name: str


class UserCreatedEvent(BaseModel):
    user: User
    timestamp: int


user_events = HandlerGroup()


@user_events.handler(topic='user_events', event='user_registered')
async def handle_user_registered(
        event: Event[UserCreatedEvent],
        user_service: Annotated[UserService, Dependency(get_user_service)]
):
    user = event.body.user
    timestamp = event.body.timestamp

    print(f"[User Registered] {user.id} - {user.email} at {timestamp}")

    await user_service.do_smth_with_the_user(event.body.user)

```

## ✨ Emitter example

```python

import uuid
from datetime import datetime

from pydantic import BaseModel
from dispytch import EventBase


class User(BaseModel):
    id: str
    email: str
    name: str


class UserEvent(EventBase):
    __topic__ = "user_events"


class UserRegistered(UserEvent):
    __event_type__ = "user_registered"

    user: User
    timestamp: int


async def example_emit(emitter):
    await emitter.emit(
        UserRegistered(
            user=User(
                id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
                email="example@mail.com",
                name="John Doe",
            ),
            timestamp=int(datetime.now().timestamp()),
        )
    )

```

## ✅ Why Dispytch?

* 🧼 **Minimal boilerplate** – Just annotate and go
* 🧪 **Testable logic** – Handlers are first-class coroutines
* 🔄 **Flexible backends** – Kafka, RabbitMQ, or bring your own
* 🧩 **Clean separation of concerns** – business logic ≠ plumbing

## ⚠️ Limitations
While dispytch is a great choice for most usecases there are some limitations to be aware of:

🧾 No schema-on-write support
Dispytch uses a schema-on-read model. Formats like Avro, Protobuf, or Thrift aren’t supported yet.

🕵️ No dead-letter queue (DLQ)
Failed messages are retried using built-in logic, but there’s no DLQ or fallback mechanism after final retries yet.

🧩 No topic pattern matching
Wildcard or templated subscriptions (e.g. user.*, order:{id}:events) aren’t supported in handler declarations yet. 
Though the backend of you choice may route events to the appropriate queues/topics/channels there is no way for a dispytch handler to know it yet
