Automatically create [semantic version](https://semver.org/) git tags.

```text
$ tag
Push tag 'v1.0.1' to origin? (y/N): y
Tag 'v1.0.1' created and pushed to origin.
```

## Usage

By default, `tag` will increment the smallest digit following [SemVer precedence](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver).
Incrementing a specific version is achieved by passing the respective flag: `--major`, `--minor`, `--patch`.

Tags can be automatically pushed to a remote repository by passing `--push`.

`tag` supports [pre-release](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9) versions.
Creating a pre-release tag is achieved by the using the `--suffix` flag.
For example, `--suffix="alpha"` will create a tag like `v1.0.0-alpha`.
If the previous tag was for a pre-release, that suffix is preferred.
This behavior can be overridden by passing `--patch` or `--suffix=""`.
Only incrementing the trailing pre-release identifier is currently supported.

`tag` authoritatively discourages duplicate tags for a single commit.

### Autocomplete

`tag` provides autocomplete for `bash`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells.
For example, to enable autocomplete for the `bash` shell,

```shell
tag completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/tag > /dev/null
```

_Note: bash completion requires the [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/) package be installed._

For more information, see `tag completion <shell> --help` for your respective `<shell>`.
