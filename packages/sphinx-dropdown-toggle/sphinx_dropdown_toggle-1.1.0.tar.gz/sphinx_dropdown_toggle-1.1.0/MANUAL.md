## Usage

When dropdowns are included on a page, initially <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-down"></i> will be shown at the top of the page near the other symbols. Clicking this will toggle all dropdowns on the page, opening them all at once.

At this point the button wil change to <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-up"></i> and clicking it again will close all dropdowns, including initially open ones, and revert the button to its original state.

## Reference examples

:::{admonition} A proof
:class: dropdown

First we consider $x_-=-ai$ and take its square:

$$
x_-^2 = \left(-ai\right)^2 = a^2i^2 = -a^2.
$$

This shows that $x_-=-ai$ is indeed a solution to the equation $x^2=-a^2$.

We repeat the same for $x_+=ai$:

$$
x_+^2 = \left(ai\right)^2 = a^2i^2 = -a^2.
$$

We also find that $x_+=ai$ is a solution to the equation $x^2=-a^2$.
