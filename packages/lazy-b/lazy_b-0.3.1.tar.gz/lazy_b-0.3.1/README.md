# lazy-b

Keep Slack, Microsoft Teams, or other similar applications from showing you as "away" or "inactive" by simulating key presses at regular intervals.

## Installation

Install directly from PyPI using pip or uv:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install lazy-b

# Using uv
uv pip install lazy-b
```

## Usage

### Command Line

Run `lazy-b` from the command line:

```bash
# Basic usage (will press Shift key every 1 second)
lazy-b

# Customize the interval (e.g., every 30 seconds)
lazy-b --interval 30
```

#### Platform-specific behavior

- **macOS**: By default, runs in background mode with no dock icon. You can close the terminal window after starting it, and it will continue to run.
- **Windows/Linux**: The application runs in the terminal window. You need to keep the window open for the program to continue running.

To stop lazy-b, you can:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal window
- On macOS, if running in background, find and kill the process:

```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep lazy-b

# Kill it using the PID
kill <PID>
```

### Python API

You can also use the Python API directly in your own scripts (works on all platforms):

```python
from lazy_b import LazyB
import time

# Create an instance with a custom interval (in seconds)
lazy = LazyB(interval=5)  # Press Shift every 5 seconds

# Define a callback function to handle status messages (optional)
def status_callback(message):
    print(f"Status: {message}")

# Start the simulation
lazy.start(callback=status_callback)

try:
    # Keep your script running
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Stop on Ctrl+C
    lazy.stop()
```

## ðŸŽ¬ Adding Custom Animations

LazyB supports ASCII animations that play while keeping your status active. You can add your own custom animations to the system.

### Animation File Structure

Animations are stored in the `animations` directory, with each animation in its own subdirectory. Each frame should be saved as a separate `.txt` file with a numbered sequence.

**Supported naming formats:**
- `frame_1.txt`, `frame_2.txt`, `frame_3.txt`, ... (frame_NUMBER.txt)
- `001_description.txt`, `002_description.txt`, `003_description.txt`, ... (NUMBER_description.txt)

**Example structure:**
```
animations/
â”œâ”€â”€ my_cool_animation/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frame_1.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frame_2.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frame_3.txt
â””â”€â”€ another_animation/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 001_start.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ 002_middle.txt
    â””â”€â”€ 003_end.txt
```

### Creating Animations from Videos

If you want to convert a video into ASCII animation, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Convert Video to ASCII Frames

1. **Clone the ASCII Animator tool:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bradysheridan/ascii-animator.git
   cd ascii-animator
   ```

2. **Upload your video file** to the ASCII Animator and process it through their system.

3. **Export the output** - you should get a `frames.js` file containing an array of ASCII frames.

#### Step 2: Convert Frames to TXT Files

1. **Place the `frames.js` file** in your LazyB `animations` directory.

2. **Run the conversion script** (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js if not already installed
   # Visit https://nodejs.org/ or use package manager
   
   cd animations
   node convertFramesToTxt.js
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to name your animation directory (avoid spaces and special characters).

4. **The script will create** a new directory with all frames converted to individual `.txt` files.

#### Step 3: Test Your Animation

1. **Run LazyB** and your new animation should appear in the selection menu:
   ```bash
   lazy-b
   ```

2. **Use arrow keys** to navigate and select your animation.

### Animation Guidelines

- **File naming**: Frames must be numbered sequentially starting from 1
- **File format**: Plain text (`.txt`) files with UTF-8 encoding
- **Frame size**: Recommended maximum 80 characters wide for terminal compatibility
- **Frame rate**: Default is 0.2 seconds per frame (5 FPS), configurable
- **Directory naming**: Use underscores instead of spaces, avoid special characters

### Troubleshooting

- **Animation not showing up?** Check that frame files follow the naming convention
- **Frames out of order?** Ensure sequential numbering without gaps
- **Display issues?** Verify files are UTF-8 encoded and frames aren't too wide

## Features

- Prevents "away" or "inactive" status in messaging applications
- **ðŸŽ¬ ASCII Animation Support**: Display entertaining animations while keeping your status active
- Interactive animation selection menu with live preview
- Customizable interval between key presses (default: 3 minutes)
- Simple command-line interface
- Cross-platform: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Background mode on macOS (no dock icon)
- Python API for integration into your own scripts
- Minimal resource usage

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lanznx/lazy-b.git
cd lazy-b

# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Install in development mode
make install
```

### Releasing New Versions

To release a new version:

```bash
# Update version, create commit and tag
make release  # This will prompt for the new version

# Push changes and tag to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin v<version>  # e.g., git push origin v0.2.0
```

Pushing a tag will automatically trigger the release workflow, which will:
1. Build the package
2. Create a GitHub release
3. Publish to PyPI

## Requirements

### Runtime Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyAutoGUI
- PyObjC-Core (for macOS dock icon hiding, optional)

### Animation Development Requirements (Optional)
- Node.js (for running the frame conversion script)
- Access to [ASCII Animator](https://github.com/bradysheridan/ascii-animator) for video-to-ASCII conversion
