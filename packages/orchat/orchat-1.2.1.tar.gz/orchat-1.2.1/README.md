## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

OrChat can be configured in multiple ways:

1. **Setup Wizard**: Run `python main.py --setup` for interactive configuration

## üìÅ File Attachment

Share files with the AI for analysis using the enhanced attachment system:

```
/attach path/to/your/file.ext
/upload path/to/your/file.ext
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Flexible Command Usage**: `/upload` and `/attach` can be used anywhere in your message, not just at the beginning
- **Quoted Path Support**: Handles file paths with spaces using quotes (`/attach "C:\path with spaces\file.txt"`)
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and usage examples
- **File Preview**: Shows file metadata and preview before processing
- **Security Validation**: Built-in file size and type validation (10MB limit)

Supported file types:

- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP, BMP (displayed visually with multimodal models)
- **Code Files**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, TypeScript, Swift, etc. (with syntax highlighting)
- **Text Documents**: TXT, MD, CSV (full content displayed)
- **Data Files**: JSON, XML (displayed with formatting)
- **Web Files**: HTML, CSS (formatted display)
- **Archives**: ZIP, TAR, GZ, RAR (basic metadata support)

<a id="thinking-mode"></a>
## üß† Thinking Mode

OrChat can display the AI's reasoning process with enhanced thinking mode:

```
/thinking-mode       # Toggle thinking mode on/off
/thinking            # Show the most recent thinking process
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Improved Detection**: Better extraction of thinking content from model responses
- **Model Compatibility**: Automatic handling of models that don't support thinking mode
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status indicators showing if thinking mode is enabled
- **Flexible Setup**: Option to enable/disable during model selection

This feature allows you to see how the AI approached your question before giving its final answer. Note that thinking mode works best with models that explicitly support `<thinking>` tags.

## üé® Themes

Change the visual appearance with the `/theme` command:

- **default**: Blue user, green assistant
- **dark**: Cyan user, magenta assistant
- **light**: Blue user, green assistant with lighter colors
- **hacker**: Matrix-inspired green text on black

## üìä Token Management

OrChat intelligently manages conversation context to keep within token limits:

- Automatically trims old messages when approaching limits
- Displays token usage statistics after each response
- Allows manual clearing of context with `/clear`

## üîÑ Updates

Check for updates with the `/update` command to see if a newer version is available.

## üÜï Recent Improvements

**Latest enhancements include:**

- **Enhanced Model Compatibility**: Improved handling of models that don't support system messages (like some Gemma variants)
- **Better Command Parsing**: `/upload` and `/attach` commands can now be used anywhere in your message
- **Improved Code Quality**: Code refinements based on pylint recommendations for better performance
- **Enhanced Environment Support**: Better handling of system environment variables
- **FZF Integration**: Powerful fuzzy search for model selection when fzf is installed
- **Streamlined User Experience**: Added `quit` as alias for `exit` and improved error messages

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## üîç Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your OpenRouter API key is correctly set in config.ini, .env file, or system environment variables
- **File Path Problems**: When using `/attach` or `/upload`, use quotes for paths with spaces and ensure correct path format for your OS
- **Model Compatibility**: Some features like thinking mode only work with specific models
- **Command Usage**: Remember that `/upload` and `/attach` can be used anywhere in your message for flexibility
