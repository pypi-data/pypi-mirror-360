"""MCS Basic Orchestrator.

This module defines a basic orchestrator for the Model Context Standard (MCS),
designed to aggregate multiple `MCSToolDriver` instances. It presents a unified
interface to a Language Model (LLM), allowing the LLM to discover and
execute tools managed by various underlying drivers.

Based on an extended MCS Driver Contract, this orchestrator abstracts
the complexities of multiple tool sources into a single, cohesive unit.

Key Responsibilities:
1.  **Tool Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates tools from all registered `MCSToolDriver`s.
2.  **LLM Function Description Generation**: Creates a comprehensive, LLM-readable
    description of all available tools for function-calling.
3.  **LLM System Message Generation**: Formulates a system prompt to guide the LLM
    on how to use the available tools and format its responses.
4.  **Tool Execution Dispatch**: Parses LLM responses for tool calls and dispatches
    them to the appropriate `MCSToolDriver` for execution.

This orchestrator enables flexible integration of diverse toolsets without requiring
the LLM or the client application to manage individual drivers.
