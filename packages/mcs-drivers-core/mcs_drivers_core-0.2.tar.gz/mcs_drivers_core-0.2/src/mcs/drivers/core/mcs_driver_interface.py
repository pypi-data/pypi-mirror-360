"""MCS core driver interface.

Based on MCS driver Contract v0.1

A driver encapsulates two mandatory responsibilities:
1. **get_function_description** – fetch a machine‑readable function spec
2. **process_llm_response** – execute a structured call emitted by the LLM

Implementations can use any transport (HTTP, CAN‑Bus, AS2, …) and any
specification format (OpenAPI, JSON‑Schema, proprietary JSON). The interface
keeps the integration surface minimal and self‑contained.

class MCSDriver(ABC):

    A driver is responsible for two core tasks:

    1.  Provide a **llm-readable function description** so an LLM can discover the available tools.
    2.  **Execute** the structured call emitted by the LLM and return the
        raw result.

    The combination of these two tasks allows any language model that
    supports function-calling to interact with the underlying system
    without knowing implementation details or transport specifics.

    Attributes
    ----------
    meta :
        :class:`DriverMeta` instance that declares protocol, transport,
        spec format and supported models.  It acts like a device-ID so an
        orchestrator can pick the right driver at runtime.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model_name :

        str

        Parameters
        ----------
        model_name :

        It is important to return the raw llm_response exactly as it was, when
        not executing was made, so that a client can determine whether the
        response was processed by the driver or not. This is necessary if
        multiple drivers were chained together.

        Parameters
        ----------
        llm_response :
            The content of the assistant message.  Typically a JSON string
            that contains the selected ``tool`` (or function name) and its
            ``arguments``.
