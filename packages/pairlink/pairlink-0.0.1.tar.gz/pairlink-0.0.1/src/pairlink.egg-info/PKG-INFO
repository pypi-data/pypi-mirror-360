# PairLink

## Description

`PairLink` is a diagnostic tool designed to evaluate the statistical relationship between two time series. 

It provides an assessment of their stationarity, cointegration, distributional characteristics, and mean-reverting behavior.

## Installation

You can install `PairLink` via pip:

```bash
pip install pairlink
```

## Usage
Here is a simple example to identify frequent price levels from your price data:
```python
import yfinance as yf
from pairlink import preprocess_series, pairlink_test

df = yf.download(tickers=['AAPL','MSFT'], interval='1D')

y, x = preprocess_series(series1=df['Close']['AAPL'], series2=df['Close']['MSFT'])
results = pairlink_test(y,x)
```
