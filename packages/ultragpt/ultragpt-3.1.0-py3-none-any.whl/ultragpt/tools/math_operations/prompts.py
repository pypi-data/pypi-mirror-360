def make_math_operations_query(message):
    return f"""You are a mathematical operations parser. Analyze the user's request and history and perform all the needed and necessary mathematical operations, which will initially help the user in their request.

Available operations:
1. "range_checks" - Check if numbers lie between ranges (a, b)
2. "proximity_checks" - Check if numbers are close to target values within tolerance
3. "statistical_analyses" - Get mean, median, mode, standard deviation of numbers
4. "prime_checks" - Check if numbers are prime
5. "factor_analyses" - Get factors and prime factorization
6. "sequence_analyses" - Check if numbers form arithmetic or geometric sequences
7. "percentage_operations" - Calculate percentages using ONLY these operation types:
   - "percentage_of_total" (calculate what percentage each number is of the total)
   - "percentage_change" (calculate percentage change between consecutive numbers)
8. "outlier_detections" - Find numbers that are outside normal range using ONLY these methods:
   - "iqr" (Interquartile Range method)
   - "zscore" (Z-score method)

IMPORTANT: For percentage_operations, ONLY use "percentage_of_total" or "percentage_change" as operation_type.
IMPORTANT: For outlier_detections, ONLY use "iqr" or "zscore" as method.
DO NOT use "subtract", "division", "add", "multiply" or any other operation types.

User request: "{message}"

Parse the request and extract all mathematical operations needed. You can perform multiple operations of the same type or different types in one request.
