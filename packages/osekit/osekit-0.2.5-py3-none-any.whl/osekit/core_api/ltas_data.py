"""LTASData is a special form of SpectroData.

The Sx values from a LTASData object are computed recursively.
LTAS should be preferred in cases where the audio is really long.
In that case, the corresponding number of time bins (scipy.ShortTimeFTT.p_nums) is
too long for the whole Sx matrix to be computed once.

The LTAS are rather computed recursively. If the number of temporal bins is higher
than a target p_num value, the audio is split in p_num parts.
A separate sft is computed on each of these bits and averaged so that the end Sx
presents p_num temporal windows.

This averaging is performed recursively:
if the audio data is such that after a first split, the p_nums for each part
still is higher than p_num, the parts are further split
and each part is replaced with an average of the stft performed within it.
