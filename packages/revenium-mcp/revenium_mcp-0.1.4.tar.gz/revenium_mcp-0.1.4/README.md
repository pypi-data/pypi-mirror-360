## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version (should be 3.11+)
python --version

# Verify dependencies are installed
pip list | grep fastmcp
pip list | grep loguru

# Try running the server directly
python run_server.py
```

#### MCP Client Can't Connect to Server
1. **Check file paths** - Ensure all paths in your MCP client configuration are absolute paths
2. **Verify API key** - Make sure your `REVENIUM_API_KEY` is set correctly in the MCP client JSON configuration
3. **Test configuration** - Use the diagnostic tool: ask your AI assistant to "Run the debug_auto_discovery tool"
4. **Check MCP client logs** - Look for connection errors in your AI assistant's logs
5. **Test API connectivity**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "x-api-key: your_api_key" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        "https://api.revenium.io/meter/profitstream/v2/api/users/me"
   ```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Reinstall all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use the automated setup script (if available)
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- Use the diagnostic tool to check configuration status
- Ensure the base URL is correct for your environment
- Check that the `/users/me` endpoint is accessible with your API key

#### Configuration Priority
The system loads configuration values in this priority order:
1. **MCP client JSON configuration `env` section** (highest priority)
2. **System environment variables**
3. **Automatically loaded values** from `/users/me` API endpoint
4. **`.env` file in project root** (development only, lowest priority)

Use the `debug_auto_discovery` tool to see exactly which values are being used from each source.

## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Topics

### Development Setup

For developers who want to contribute or customize the MCP server:

```bash
# Clone and setup for development
git clone https://github.com/revenium/revenium-mcp.git
cd revenium-mcp

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Code formatting
black src tests
isort src tests

# Type checking
mypy src
```

### Development Configuration (.env files)

When developing or testing the MCP server directly (outside of an MCP client), you can use `.env` files for configuration:

**Create a `.env` file in the project root:**

```bash
# Required - Only your API key is needed
REVENIUM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here                    # Your account API key from Revenium

# Optional development settings
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30                                    # API request timeout in seconds
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                                        # Logging verbosity (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)
```

**Optional overrides for development:**

```bash
# Automatically loaded values (override only if needed for testing)
REVENIUM_TEAM_ID=ABC123x                              # Team ID (loaded from /users/me)
REVENIUM_TENANT_ID=DEF456n                            # Tenant ID (loaded from /users/me)
REVENIUM_OWNER_ID=GHI789z                             # User ID (loaded from /users/me)
REVENIUM_DEFAULT_EMAIL=your_email@company.com         # Default email (loaded from /users/me)
REVENIUM_BASE_URL=https://api.revenium.io/meter       # API endpoint (defaults to main Revenium instance)
```

**When to use .env files:**
- **Direct server testing**: Running `python run_server.py` for development
- **Local debugging**: Testing outside of MCP client context
- **Shared team configurations**: Common settings for development teams
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment

**Test the server directly:**

```bash
# Test that the server starts correctly
python run_server.py
```

You should see output indicating the MCP server is running successfully.
