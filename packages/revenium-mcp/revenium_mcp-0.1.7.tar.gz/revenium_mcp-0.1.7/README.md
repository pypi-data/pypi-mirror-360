# Revenium MCP Server

**Connect AI agents to Revenium**

Connect Claude, OpenAI, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant to Revenium's API for AI cost alerts & tracking as well as usage-based billing for AI products. 

## AI Cost Tracking & Alerting - **Never Be Surprised by Unexpected AI Costs Again**
- Configure development agents to set up AI cost alerts for newly implemented AI-backed features to avoid unexpected costs
- Ask AI agents to track their own costs with Revenium as they carry out actions within your application
- Ask AI agents to develop AI cost & usage trends over time and set up alerts to immediately send slack or email notifications when anomalies occur
- Quickly investigate the reasons for AI cost spikes. Identify abnormal changes in spending by agent, API key, product, customer, and more.
- Help AI agents to integrate Revenium metering into your applications if not using Revenium's pre-built SDKs


## Usage-based Billing & Chargebacks
- Manage all elements of usage-based billing & cost chargebacks
- Manage products, customers, subscriptions, and subscriber credentials

## üîç Troubleshooting

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- Use the diagnostic tool to check configuration status
- Ensure the base URL is correct for your environment
- Check that the `/users/me` endpoint is accessible with your API key

#### Configuration Priority
The system loads configuration values in this priority order:
1. **MCP client JSON configuration `env` section** (highest priority)
2. **System environment variables**
3. **Automatically loaded values** from Revenium's API

Use the `system_diagnostics` tool to see exactly which values are being used from each source.
