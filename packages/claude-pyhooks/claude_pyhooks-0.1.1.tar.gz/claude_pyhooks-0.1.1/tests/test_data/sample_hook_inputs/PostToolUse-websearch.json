            "Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive guide for a Python \"Hello, World!\" example:\n\n## Basic Python Hello World Example\n\nThe simplest way to write a \"Hello, World!\" program in Python is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe `print()` is a function that tells the computer to perform an action. We know it is a function because it uses parentheses. `print()` tells Python to display or output whatever we put in the parentheses.(no content)Inside the parentheses of the print() function is a sequence of characters \u2014 Hello, World! \u2014 that is enclosed in quotation marks. Any characters that are inside of quotation marks are called a string.\n\n## Running the Program\n\nThere are several ways to run this Python program:\n\n### Method 1: Save as a Python file\n1. Create a file called hello.py in any text editor\n2. Add the print statement to the file\n3. Save the file\n4. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:\n   ```\n   python hello.py\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   python3 hello.py\n   ```\n\n### Method 2: Python Interactive Mode\nTo test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.\n\nYou can type `python` or `python3` in your terminal to enter interactive mode, then type:\n```python\n>>> print(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nWhich will write \"Hello, World!\"\n\n## Creating a Function Version\n\nYou can also create a function that prints personalized greetings:\n\n```python\ndef print_hello_world(name):\n    print(\"Hello\", name, \"!\")\n\n# Calling the function\nprint_hello_world(\"Alice\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nHello Alice !\n```\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- `print()` is a built-in function in Python that tells the program to display something on the screen. We need to add the string in parenthesis of print() function that we are displaying on the screen.\n- \"Hello, World!\" is a string text that you want to display. Strings are always enclosed in quotation marks.\n- A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. The quotation marks can be single (` ' `) or double (` \" `), and in this case, double quotation marks are used.\n\nThis simple program is a rite of passage for beginners and a great way to get acquainted with Python."
