## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately using [GitHub's built-in reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):

1. Navigate to Security. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the dropdown menu, and then click Security.
2. Click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability.

This process ensures that your report is handled confidentially and reaches the maintainers directly.

Thank you for helping to keep the project secure!
