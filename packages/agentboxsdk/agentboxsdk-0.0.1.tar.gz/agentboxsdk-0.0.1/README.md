# AgentBox 🧠📦

**The modular SDK for building, embedding, and orchestrating autonomous AI agents.**  
Seamlessly integrate powerful local or cloud-based language models into your applications, with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.

## 🚀 What is AgentBox?

AgentBox is a developer-first SDK and runtime that simplifies the process of:
- Building custom AI agents using modern LLMs (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- Defining agent workflows using tools, memory, and goals
- Running agents locally or remotely with plug-and-play setup
- Embedding agent APIs into your existing software or systems

Whether you're building an AI co-pilot, task automation engine, or multi-agent system — AgentBox gives you the building blocks.
