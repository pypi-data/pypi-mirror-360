This is a simple command line tool with one purpose: It takes a markdown file that has been written with 
each paragraph on a single line (i.e. no newlines between sentences) and returns a the same file with
newlines added between each sentence.  The use case is when one generates text for uploading to a 
blog site, but then wants the text committed to the repository to have one sentence per line for 
easier diffing.
