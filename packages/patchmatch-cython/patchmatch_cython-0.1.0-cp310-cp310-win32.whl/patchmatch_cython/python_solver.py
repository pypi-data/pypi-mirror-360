    """
    Python implementation of the PatchMatch algorithm for image inpainting.

    This class provides a pure Python implementation of the PatchMatch algorithm,
    inheriting from the base :class:`Solver` class. It performs image inpainting
    by finding approximate nearest neighbors between patches in the source image
    and reconstructing the masked regions.

    The algorithm works by iteratively improving a nearest neighbor field (NNF)
    through propagation and random search steps, alternating between forward
    and backward passes for better convergence.
