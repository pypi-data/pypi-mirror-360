    Python wrapper for Cython-accelerated PatchMatch solver implementation.
    
    This class provides a high-performance implementation of the PatchMatch algorithm
    using Cython for acceleration. It automatically falls back to the pure Python
    implementation if the Cython extension is not available.
    
    The class wraps the low-level Cython implementation and handles type conversions
    between Python and Cython data types. It maintains the same interface as the
    base :class:`Solver` class while providing significant performance improvements.
