    - Click generate release notes,
    - Update Release tite to align with "morpc-v1.2.3"

5. Go to [morpc pip site](https://pypi.org/project/morpc/) to check it is updated. 

## Version numbering

The version numbering is based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules. See the website for more details. 

The basic format is major.minor.patch

Major numbers are for major breaking changes to the package. 0 is always for development, pre-release versions. 

Minor changes are changes that add functionality but are backward compatible.

Patch is for minor fixes and updates. 

Always increment the appropriate number by only one. Do not use leading zeros.
