# Documentation Audit Report

## Summary
This audit identifies documentation issues following the removal of AI/ML, satellite, community detection, Plotly, and Streamlit features from SocialMapper.

## 1. References to Removed Features Found

### Files with References to Removed Features:
1. **docs/getting-started/installation.md**
   - Line 83: References `[ai]` extra in development installation
   - Lines 82-83: `pip install -e .[dev,ai]`

2. **docs/CHANGELOG.md**
   - Contains historical references to removed features in version history
   - This is appropriate as it documents historical changes

3. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Clean - focuses on current ETL architecture
   - No references to removed features

4. **docs/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md**
   - Clean - documents core architecture improvements
   - No references to removed features

5. **Other documentation files**
   - Various historical references in release notes and migration guides
   - These are appropriate as they document the evolution of the project

## 2. Missing Documentation Files

The following files are referenced in mkdocs.yml but do not exist:

### Getting Started Section
- `getting-started/quick-start.md`

### User Guide Section
- `user-guide/index.md`
- `user-guide/configuration.md`
- `user-guide/data-sources.md`
- `user-guide/features.md`

### Tutorials Section
- `tutorials/index.md`
- `tutorials/basic-usage.md`
- `tutorials/advanced-mapping.md`
- `tutorials/custom-analysis.md`

### Examples Section
- `examples/index.md`

### Integrations Section
- `integrations/index.md`
- `integrations/address-geocoding.md`
- `integrations/osm-features.md`

### API Reference Section
- `api/index.md`
- `api/core.md`
- `api/data.md`
- `api/utilities.md`

### Development Section
- `development/index.md`
- `development/contributing.md`
- `development/architecture.md`
- `development/releases.md`

### About Section
- `about/index.md`
- `about/license.md`

## 3. Missing Required Directories/Files

### MkDocs Theme Requirements
- `docs/_static/` directory (referenced in mkdocs.yml custom_dir)
- `docs/includes/abbreviations/abbreviations.md` (referenced in markdown_extensions)

### Existing Asset Files
- `docs/assets/css/extra.css` - exists
- `docs/assets/js/extra.js` - exists

## 4. Documentation Structure Issues

### Current State
The documentation has many placeholder references in mkdocs.yml but most documentation pages don't exist. This creates a poor user experience with broken links.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Remove `[ai]` reference from installation.md
   - Either create the missing documentation files or update mkdocs.yml to only reference existing files
   - Create the missing `_static` directory for the Material theme custom_dir
   - Create the `includes/abbreviations/abbreviations.md` file or remove the reference

2. **Documentation Focus:**
   The documentation should emphasize:
   - Core demographic and accessibility analysis
   - ETL pipeline for community data
   - Travel time isochrone generation
   - Census data integration
   - Static map generation
   - POI (Points of Interest) discovery
   - Export capabilities for further analysis

3. **Streamlined Navigation:**
   Consider simplifying the navigation structure to match available documentation:
   ```yaml
   nav:
     - Home: index.md
     - Getting Started:
       - getting-started/index.md
       - Installation: getting-started/installation.md
       - Demo: DEMO_INSTRUCTIONS.md
     - Features:
       - Address Geocoding: ADDRESS_GEOCODING.md
       - OSMnx Integration: OSMNX_FEATURES.md
     - Architecture: ARCHITECTURE.md
     - Development:
       - Refactoring Summary: REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
     - Changelog: CHANGELOG.md
   ```

## 5. Content That Aligns with Streamlined Focus

The following documentation properly reflects the streamlined focus:
- Main index.md - emphasizes demographic analysis and accessibility
- ARCHITECTURE.md - describes ETL pipeline approach
- REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md - documents core improvements
- ADDRESS_GEOCODING.md - core geocoding feature
- OSMNX_FEATURES.md - network analysis capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Update mkdocs.yml to reference only existing documentation
2. Remove references to `[ai]` extra from installation guide
3. Create minimal missing directories (_static, includes)
4. Consider creating essential missing documentation pages or removing their references
5. Ensure all documentation emphasizes the core mission: demographic and accessibility analysis
