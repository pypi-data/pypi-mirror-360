    Periphyton is defined by [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/) as ''Mixture of
    algae, cyanobacteria, microbes, and detritus that coats submerged surfaces in
    most bodies of water.''

    see a precedent for ''periphytic biofilm'' here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.684903/full

    subclasses:

    - Epilithon: Periphyton colonizing rock substrata.

    - Epipelon: Periphyton colonizing silt substrata.

    - Epiphyton: Periphyton colonizing surface of aquatic plants.

    - Epipsammon: Periphyton colonizing sand substrata.

    \ obsolete)\nI think any \"planned P\" where P is in scope for ENVO should follow\
    \ a DP template and always have a logical definition.\nCurrent 'planned deforestation'\
    \ is:\ndef _A planned process during which humans convert forests into one or\
    \ more alternative ecosystem types._\nSubClassOf:\n - 'planned process' (OBI)\n\
    \ - 'has active participant' some 'Homo sapiens'\n - 'has part' some deforestation\n\
    I think it's always good to have clear starts and ends for processes. The above\
    \ definition and axioms encompasses processes that have deforestation as a part,\
    \ but may range much further upstream or downstream. For example, many wars would\
    \ fit this definition.\nI would advocate for something like:\n_A deforestation\
    \ that is planned and executed by humans_\n    EquivalentTo: deforestation and\
    \ realizes some concretizes some plan specification\n(I don't love the complexity\
    \ of the differentia, but this comes from OBI http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000011)\n\
    This makes it a subclass of the existing deforestation class. We have a logical\
    \ definition, so we get required automatic inferences (subclass of OBI planned\
    \ process).\nThis pattern can be applied to any planned variant of an existing\
    \ environmental process\nHOWEVER, I would consider whether we truly need to precompose\
    \ here. I would much rather provide a more minimal set of classes and have people\
    \ indicate the degree of planning or other attributes when they use the class.\
    \ precomposition makes an ontology harder to maintain and harder for users to\
    \ use.\nAnother oddity here is that the class 'deforestation' has a text definition\
    \ _The removal of forest and undergrowth to, for example, increase the surface\
    \ of arable land or to use the timber for construction or industrial purposes._\n\
    Source: https://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept?cp=2036 (aside: no longer resolves)\n\
    The definition and examples sound indistinguishable from planned deforestation\
    \ to me, although I think the OBI definition is hard to understand. E.g is slash\
    \ and burn agriculture a planned process according to the OBI definition?"
