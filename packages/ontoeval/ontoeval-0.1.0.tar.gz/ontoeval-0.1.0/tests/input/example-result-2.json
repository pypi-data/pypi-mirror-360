In most organisms, this pathway links glycolysis to the TCA cycle, by a series of three reactions carried out by a multisubunit complex called the 'pyruvate dehydrogenase complex', even though pyruvate dehydrogenase activity describes only one of those reactions.\n\n* **Reference, in format PMID:#######**\nPMID:15855260\n\n* **Gene product name and ID to be annotated to this term**\nhuman PDP1 (Q9P0J1)\n\n* **Parent term(s)**\nGO:0010510 regulation of pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA\n\n\n</body>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\n\nWe captured this as part_of with direct positive regulation/activation\nhttps://www.pombase.org/gocam/gene/67086be200000251/SPAC10F6.17c/ptc5\n\nIs this not the correct way to do this?\nI'm constantly confused by this so it would be useful if we can get an answer when we meet in Geneva.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\nMy understanding is that pathway regulation is part of the regulation of activity. So this one depends on the pathway start, I guess.\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: pgaudet\n<comment>\nIf I am not mistaken, the pombe orthologs is [pkp1 Spom](https://www.pombase.org/gene/SPAC644.11c)\n\nWhich you have annotated to a regulation BP:\n> [pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring) kinase activity](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004740)\npart of\n[regulation of acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from pyruvate](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010510)\noccurs in\n[mitochondrion](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739)\n\nSo, the positive regulation seems more appropriate? \n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\nThe pdp1 ortholog is ptc5\npyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA\nmitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) phosphatase\n\nwhich we have annotated to part_of\n\nPkp1 is the phosphate we have annotated to \"regulation\" so yes this is inconsistent.\n\nThis one of the questions I wanted to ask, should these be annotated to regulation  if they are considered part of the pathway?\n\nThese 2 regulators are both 'downstream' of pyruvate, so they must be part_of the pathway.\n\nHow does this differ from any other enzyme activator or inhibitor? We don't annotate these to +/- regulation of process?\n\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\nFor example here:\nhttps://www.pombase.org/gocam/gene/6690711d00002706/SPBC14C8.04/ilv6\nis an activator of Ilv1 but I annotated as part_of  the amino acid biosynthesis pathways rather than \n\"regulation of\"\nhttps://www.pombase.org/gene/SPBC14C8.04\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: rozaru\n<comment>\n> Is this not the correct way to do this?\n> I'm constantly confused by this so it would be useful if we can get an answer when we meet in Geneva.\n\nWhen I started to make GO_CAM I asked about the difference between the regulatory terms for single annotation and the regulation relationship used in GO CAM. Someone (unfortunately I don’t remember who) said that they are 2 different type of annotations and I should carry on using regulatory terms for single annotation. Is this not true anymore?\n\nI agree with Val it would be good to know\n\n- where to draw the line between part of a pathway and regulates a pathway for enzymes that directly affects the activity of the main participants of a pathway \n- when to use enzyme regulator activity and regulation of activity\n\nFor the pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA pathway:\n\n- pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphorylates and inhibits the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex \nWhich annotation is appropriate:\nnegative regulation of pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA pathway\nenzyme inhibitor activity\n\n- pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDK) dephosphorylates and activates the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex \nWhich annotation is appropriate:\npositive regulation of pyruvate decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA pathway\nenzyme activator activity\nIn fly this protein is involved in other pathways\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\n@pgaudet  can we put this high on the agenda for the GO-CAM meeting day. The guidelines here are very unclear.\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: pgaudet\n<comment>\nAdded, thanks for the suggestion.\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: edwong57\n<comment>\n@pgaudet @ValWood Was this resolved at the GO meeting? Could you point me to the discussion/minutes?\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\nWe didn't get through the presentations so there were no discussion on specific problems.\n\n@vanaukenk  can this be discussed  on a future GO-CAM call?\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: vanaukenk\n<comment>\n@ValWood @rozaru - yes, we can definitely put this on a GO-CAM call agenda.\nThis coming Thursday, the 22nd, Paul D. is scheduled to speak, but we could have another call next week, if people want.\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\nI already have an immovable meeting next week \n3:00 PM–7:30 PM BST which is over the GO-CaM slot so maybe the week after?\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: vanaukenk\n<comment>\n@ValWood  - sure we could plan for Thursday, June 5th.  Please confirm.  Thanks!\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: edwong57\n<comment>\n@vanaukenk, June 5 works for me.\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: ValWood\n<comment>\nI won't be able to confirm this date until the week starting June 6th. I'm officially on holiday for a couple weeks in June, but that week is the Elixir all-hands meeting, and I have committed to a workshop; I don't have the details yet. I will be working some days but not sure which ones.\n\n\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: edwong57\n<comment>\n@ValWood have you figured a date that works for you to discuss this at a GO-CAM call?\n</comment>\n\nComment:\nAuthor: pgaudet\n<comment>\n+[Term]\n+id: GO:0140176\n+name: positive regulation of acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from pyruvate\n+namespace: biological_process\n+def: \"Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate.
