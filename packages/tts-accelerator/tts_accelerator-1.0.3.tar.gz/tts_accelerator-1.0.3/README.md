## TTS Accelerator

> Real-time natural speech generation ‚Äî delivers real-time, natural speech from text in as little as 2-3 seconds, handling even extremely long sentences (16,000+ words) with instant voice output‚Äîno waiting or file saving.


This library works entirely in RAM to make speech super fast using the Edge-TTS engine. Edge-TTS sounds great, but it slows way down when you ask it to read long sentences‚Äîthat was a big bottleneck for real-time apps. TTS Accelerator fixes that: it starts talking in just 2‚Äì3 seconds, even for thousands of words, by streaming audio straight from memory with no file saves or delays. Whether you‚Äôre building a chatbot or powering my AI assistant Nisha, who needs instant replies, this tool makes your app feel quick, smart, and alive.

## What Problem It Solves‚ùì

Most TTS systems force you to wait while they generate the entire audio file ‚Äî especially for long texts ‚Äî before playback starts.

That‚Äôs slow, frustrating, and unusable for real-time apps.

*TTS Accelerator solves this by streaming audio in real time.*  
It starts playback in just 2‚Äì3 seconds, even for huge texts. No disk I/O, no waiting ‚Äî just seamless, instant voice output.  
Perfect for:
- Voice assistants
- Chatbots
- Narration tools
- Live reading apps

## üí°Insight


TTS Accelerator is designed for ultra-fast playback.
Unlike typical TTS systems that wait for full audio generation, this one begins speaking within 2‚Äì3 seconds ‚Äî even for texts up to 16,000+ words. It streams while generating, offering smooth, natural output with zero delay.


## ‚ú®Key Features

- **Super Fast Speech (Real-Time TTS)**: Begins speaking in just 2‚Äì3 seconds, even for extremely long texts ‚Äî up to 16,000+ words.
- **Highly Compatible**: Seamlessly works with popular TTS engines like Edge-TTS (tested), Coqui TTS etc.. 
- **Streaming Playback**: Audio starts playing instantly while it‚Äôs still being generated ‚Äî no delay, no wait.
- **Minimal API**: Just a single function call to start speaking ‚Äî `speak_text(text)`.
- **Zero-Delay Playback**: Audio plays with zero delay, It is a smart system that uses fast RAM-based buffering and a separate producer-consumer pipeline to keep things smooth and super quick.


## üß†Why we Made This Library

While working on our personal AI assistant, Nisha, we (Uday Subba & Ranjit Das) ran into a huge bottleneck:  
Most TTS libraries either sounded robotic or took forever to generate long sentences ‚Äî especially when trying to keep the voice natural.

We needed something *fast enough for real-time conversation* but still *clear and human-like* ‚Äî and nothing we found was good enough.  
That‚Äôs why we built *TTS Accelerator*.

It streams audio from text in just seconds, even for huge inputs, and it feels natural ‚Äî exactly what Nisha needed to sound like a confident and responsive AI.

> So yes ‚Äî this library is not just an experiment, it powers a bigger dream.

## üìöExamples

Simple Usage:

```python
# Import the library
import tts_accelerator as tts

# Example long text to demonstrate real-time speech generation.
text = (
    "Imagine reading out a 1,000-word story or a chatbot message stream ‚Äî "
    "normally, you'd wait several seconds or even minutes before hearing anything. "
    "But with tts-accelerator, audio playback begins in just 2‚Äì3 seconds, "
    "no matter how long the input is. It streams audio directly from RAM, "
    "without saving to disk, and keeps the voice natural and fluid throughout. "
    "This makes it perfect for assistants, narrators, or any real-time voice-based apps."
)

# Speak the text ‚Äî playback starts almost instantly
tts.speak_text(text)
# it will generate the audio in less than 3 seconds regardless of number of lines in the 'text variable'
```
