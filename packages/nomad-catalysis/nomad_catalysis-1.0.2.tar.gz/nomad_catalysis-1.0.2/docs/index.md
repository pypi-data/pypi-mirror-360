# Welcome to the `nomad-catalysis` documentation

This is the documentation for the NOMAD plugin for heterogeneous catalysis data. It
provides an overview of the supported entry types, their sub-sections and quantities and
a guide of how to use the plugin and effectively manage and share catalysis research data
in NOMAD.

This plugin was developed as part of Task Area E2 "Heterogeneous Catalysis" of the
[FAIRmat](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat) project within the German National Research Data
Infrastucture ([NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de)). The latest release v1.0.1 is part of the [central NOMAD repository](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/gui/search/heterogeneouscatalyst) deployment. New features of the main branch can be tested in the
[Example Oasis](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/oasis/gui/) provided by FAIRmat/NOMAD-lab.
NOMAD facilitates the collection, storage, analysis and dissemination of research data,
adhering to the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
data management.


## Introduction

This plugin aims at facilitating the catalysis researcher's life by providing a flexible
tool to manage, visualize, analyze and share catalyst and reactivity data. It is still in development and feedback about the plugin and documentation is always welcome.

## Included Entry Types
This plugin includes two new NOMAD entry types: `CatalystSample` and `CatalyticReaction`. More information can be found in the [References](reference/references.md) and the [How-to guides](How_to/use_this_plugin.md).
