The First-Fit Decreasing algorithm implementation is performing optimally on all test cases while being extremely fast. Since it's matching the Oracle's solutions exactly and runs in negligible time, no further optimization is needed. The current solution is both correct and efficient.

```
eval
```
[INPUT_SEPARATOR]
I see the error - the eval command was incorrectly formatted. Let me try again with the proper input format to verify the solution's performance across all test cases.

```
eval_input {"capacity": 100, "num_items": 5, "items": [30, 40, 20, 50, 10]}
```

The current solution is performing extremely well with just the optimized FFD heuristic. To ensure we're not missing any potential optimizations, let's profile the solution on a sample input to identify any remaining bottlenecks.
```
profile {"capacity": 100, "num_items": 20, "items": [30, 40, 20, 50, 10, 60, 70, 80, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 5, 95, 10, 20]}
