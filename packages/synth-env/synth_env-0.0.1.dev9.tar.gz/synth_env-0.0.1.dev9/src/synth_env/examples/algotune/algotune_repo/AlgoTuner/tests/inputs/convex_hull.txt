[INPUT_SEPARATOR]
Okay, the Numba-accelerated Monotone Chain algorithm performed very well.

To understand the performance breakdown better, let's profile the current `solver.py` using the example input. This might reveal if any non-Numba parts are taking significant time, although on small inputs, the overhead might dominate.

```bash
profile solver.py '{"n": 6, "points": [[0.1, 0.2], [0.5, 0.7], [0.3, 0.1], [0.9, 0.3], [0.4, 0.8], [0.7, 0.5]]}'
```
[INPUT_SEPARATOR]
```bash
ls
```
[INPUT_SEPARATOR]
```python
ls
```
[INPUT_SEPARATOR]
```bash
{"cmd": "ls"}
```
