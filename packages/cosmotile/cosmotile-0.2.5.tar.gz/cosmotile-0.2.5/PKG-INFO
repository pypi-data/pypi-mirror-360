_Create cosmological lightcones from coeval simulations._

This algorithm is taken from the code in https://github.com/piyanatk/cosmotile, but
is repackaged and re-tooled.

## Features

- Fast tiling of finite, periodic cosmic simulations onto arbitrary angular coordinates.
- Generate different realizations by translation and rotation.

## Installation

You can install _Cosmotile_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install cosmotile
```

## Usage

Please see the [Command-line Reference] for details.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.
To learn more, see the [Contributor Guide].

## License

Distributed under the terms of the [MIT license][license],
_Cosmotile_ is free and open source software.

## Issues

If you encounter any problems,
please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.

## Credits

This project was generated from [@cjolowicz]'s [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter] template.

The algorithm used in this repository is derived from the `cosmotile` module in
https://github.com/nithyanandan/AstruUtils, which was later modularised in
https://github.com/piyanatk/cosmotile.
