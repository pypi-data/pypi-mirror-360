<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This Python package simplifies Club Sport web management by allowing the
Club Sport website to be the ground truth of information, with
additional web apps able to parse data from it. See the documentation
for supported functionality.

## Installation

``` sh
$ pip install clubsports
```

## Usage

Documentation can be found hosted on this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/aliceheiman/clubsports)’s
[pages](https://aliceheiman.github.io/clubsports/). Additionally you can
find package manager specific guidelines on
[conda](https://anaconda.org/aliceheiman/clubsports) and
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/clubsports/) respectively.

## How to use

Let’s say we want to fetch information about the Stanford Cycling Team.

``` python
from clubsports.pipe import get_roster, get_stories
```

``` python
roster_url = "https://stanfordclubsports.com/sports/cycling/roster/"
get_roster(roster_url)[0]
```

    {'title': 'Head Coach',
     'name': 'Adrian Bennett',
     'profile_url': 'https://stanfordclubsports.com/sports/cycling/roster/coaches/adrian-bennett/255'}

``` python
home_url = "https://stanfordclubsports.com/sports/cycling/"
get_stories(home_url)[0]
```

    {'title': '2025 USA Cycling Collegiate Road National Championships',
     'date': '2025-07-05T16:01:00',
     'story_url': 'https://stanfordclubsports.com/news/2025/7/5/2025-usa-cycling-collegiate-road-national-championships.aspx',
     'image_url': 'https://stanfordclubsports.com/images/2025/7/5/nationals.jpg',
