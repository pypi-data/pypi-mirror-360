[CDF-25148] Migration model round 2 (#1706)

# Description

This updates the migration command to support migration of consumption
apps (for example Canvas) and ingestion.

I am not bumping the version of the model from `v1->v2`. Two reasons for
this. This is an alpha feature, so we can change without notice. In
addition, I checked mixpanel and no-one has deployed the current version
of this model (besides myself) so it will not impact anyone.
