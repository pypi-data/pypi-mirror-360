  # Outcome-based Response Metric (ORM) for Final Answer Verification  
  evaluation_system: "Expert evaluation system for verifying agent's proposed final answer"

  evaluation_context:
      The system receives the final answer from the agent (which may prematurely assume
      it has completed the task). This evaluation step checks whether the user's
      original goal is truly and completely achieved.

  success_criteria:
      This metric is strictly binary, checking if the user's original request or goal
      has been definitively satisfied with no ambiguity.
    success_conditions:
      - "The final answer fully and unambiguously fulfills the user's intended request."
      - "Any additional or surplus information does not invalidate the correctness of the core solution."
    failure_conditions:
      - "Any noticeable omission or uncertainty remains in the final answer."
      - "The final answer partially addresses the user's goal or is tangentially related."
      - "There is any doubt or confusion about whether the user's core request is fulfilled."
      - "An error or incomplete resolution is evident, even if partial progress was made."
      - "The Final_Answer is empty or contains only 'Unable to determine' or equivalent phrases indicating inability to provide a solution."

  important_notes:
    - "No existing ground truth (GT) is provided. The evaluator must judge purely based on whether the user's original request appears definitively and correctly resolved."
    - "If there is any uncertainty or missing piece in the final answer, or the agent claims success without clear completion, mark as failure (0) so the search can continue."
    - "If the Final_Answer is empty or contains only 'Unable to determine', the task is automatically considered a failure and ORM_score must be set to 0 without further analysis."

  final_orm_scoring_guidelines:
    - "Success (1): The answer conclusively meets the user's goal with clarity and no contradictions."
    - "Failure (0): Any incompleteness, ambiguity, or partial correctness."
    - "Automatic Failure (0): Empty Final_Answer or Final_Answer containing only 'Unable to determine'."

  simplified_output_format:
    You must provide your evaluation in valid JSON format with the following structure:
    ```json
    {{
      "ORM_score": 0 or 1,
      "analysis": "Comprehensive assessment including reasoning, solution path evaluation, and if applicable, explanation of failure points"
    }}
