  Evaluate the consistency of the core content of the golden answer and the other answer
  # Scoring Criteria 
    1) 2 points: the information between the golden answer and the other answer completely consistent, although the expression methods can be different. 
    2) 1 point: the other answer contains all the information of the golden answer but has additional valid information.
    3) 0 point: the other answer lacks the necessary key information of the golden answer, or there are contradictions in both the information.
  
  # Examples:
    1) Examples for 2 points: 
        1.1) two answers are completely consistent:
            - Golden answer: Interest rates should be raised and inflation should be monitored.
            - Other answer: It is necessary to raise interest rates and monitor inflation.
    2) Examples for 1 point: 
        2.1) the other answer contains all the information of the golden answer and adds extra useful information:
        - Golden answer: The interest rates should be raised.
        - Other answer: The interest rates should be raised and inflation should be monitored.
    3) Examples for 0 point: 
        3.1) the other answer lacks the key information of the golden answer:
        - Golden answer: The interest rates should be raised and inflation should be monitored.
        - Other answer: The interest rates should be raised.
        3.2) the other answer has contradictions:
        - Golden answer: Interest rates should be raised by 50 basis points.
        - Other answer: Interest rates should be raised by 25 basis points.

  Evaluate the consistency of the core content of the golden answer and the other answer.
  Please return two values in JSON format as required without any irrelevant content, their keys are: 
  1. recall_answer: bool, whether the other answer contains all the information of the golden answer.
  2. valid_num: int, the amount of valid information in the other answer.
  
  # Examples:
    1)  - Golden answer: Interest rates should be raised and inflation should be monitored.
        - Other answer: It is necessary to raise interest rates and monitor inflation.
        - Output: recall_answer=True, valid_num=1
  
    2)  - Golden answer: The interest rates should be raised.
        - Other answer: The interest rates should be raised and inflation should be monitored.
        - Output: recall_answer=True, valid_num=2
  
    3)  - Golden answer: China
        - Other answer: The BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
        - Output: recall_answer=True, valid_num=5
  
    4)  - Golden answer: The interest rates should be raised and inflation should be monitored.
        - Other answer: The interest rates should be raised.
        - Output: recall_answer=False, valid_num=1

  developer_prompt = '''
  **Task**: Validate if a given "superset" can uniquely identify a "subset" based on the provided "relationship".  
  
  **Rules**:  
  1. **Superset-Subset Relationship**:  
    - The "superset" must be a true generalization of the "subset" (e.g., "Animal" is a valid superset of "Dog").  
    - The "superset" CANNOT be a synonym of the "subset" (e.g., "Car" and "Automobile" are invalid).  
  
  2. **Relationship Validity**:  
    - The relationship must **explicitly and uniquely** link the superset to the subset.    
    - It CANNOT be a **many-to-one mapping**.  
  
  **Output Format**:  
  Return a JSON with the key `new_query`. The value should be:  
  - `"valid"` if the superset and relationship can uniquely locate the subset.  
  - `"invalid"` otherwise.  
  
  **Example Valid Output**:  
  {"new_query": "valid"}
