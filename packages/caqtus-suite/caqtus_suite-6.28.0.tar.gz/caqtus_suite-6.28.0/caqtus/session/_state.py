    Each sequence in the experiment session has a state. Only sequences in the DRAFT
    state can have their configuration modified. Only sequences in the RUNNING state
    can have data added to them.

    Attributes:
        DRAFT: The sequence was not started yet and is still being edited.
            When the sequence is passed to the experiment manager, it will transition
            to the PREPARING state.
        PREPARING: The sequence is being prepared to run.
            It is currently acquiring the necessary resources and devices.
            No shot have been scheduled to run yet.
            The sequence cannot be interrupted while it is preparing.
            If the preparation succeeds, the sequence will transition to the RUNNING
            state.
            If the preparation fails, the sequence will transition to the CRASHED state.
        RUNNING: The sequence is currently running shots.
            When all shots are completed, the sequence will transition to the FINISHED
            state.
            If the sequence is interrupted, it will transition to the INTERRUPTED state.
            If an error occurs while running the sequence, it will transition to the
            CRASHED state.
        FINISHED: The sequence was successfully run and all shots were completed.
        INTERRUPTED: The user interrupted the sequence while it was running.
        CRASHED: An error occurred while running the sequence.

    The states FINISHED, INTERRUPTED and CRASHED are terminal states. Once a sequence is
    in one of these states, the only way to change its state is to erase all associated
    data and reset it back to the DRAFT state.
