"""This module defines what can be output by a sequencer channel.

Classes that inherit from :class:`ChannelOutput` declare what should be output by a
channel.
They can be evaluated to a :class:`EvaluatedOutput` object, which contains the sequence
of values to output and their units.

A channel output can be dependent on another channel output.
This allows the user to build complex evaluation pipelines for what should be output
by a sequencer channel.
