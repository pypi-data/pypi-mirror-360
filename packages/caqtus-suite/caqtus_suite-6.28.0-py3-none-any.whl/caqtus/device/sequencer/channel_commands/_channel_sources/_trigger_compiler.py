    """Defines the interface for a compiler that can compute the trigger of a device.

    The interface defined by this class is used when a sequencer is programmed to output
    the trigger for a device on one of its channels.
    To compute the trigger, the sequencer inspects the other device compiler and checks
    that it is a :class:`TriggerCompiler`.
    If that is the case, the sequencer calls the method :meth:`compute_trigger` of the
    other device compiler to know what to output.
