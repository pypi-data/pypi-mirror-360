"""This module defines recoverable exceptions.

These are exceptions that can occur during the normal execution of a program, for
example when the user enters an invalid value, or when a connection to an external
resource fails.

These errors will not crash caqtus applications, but instead will be caught and
displayed to the user, so that they can fix the error and retry the operation.

Exceptions that are not recoverable will not be caught, and are allowed to crash
the applications.

Only make exceptions recoverable if you expect them to happen in normal operation.
