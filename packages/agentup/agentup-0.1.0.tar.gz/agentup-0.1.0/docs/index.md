# AgentUp Documentation

**Build production-ready A2A-compliant AI agents with confidence**

## Welcome to AgentUp!

AgentUp is the fastest way to build, test, and deploy AI agents that speak the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. Whether you're creating a single specialized agent or orchestrating a multi-agent system, AgentUp handles the complexity so you can focus on what matters: your agent's unique capabilities.

## Why AgentUp?

### Zero to Production in Minutes

Skip weeks of setup or trying to grok the right way to use some huge sprawling
framework, where everyone is left to their own devices around how to use it. With AgentUp you can craft a full set of fully customizable, but batteries included AI Agents.

### A2A Interoperability

AgentUp is built from the ground up to be **A2A compliant**. This means your agents can seamlessly communicate with other A2A agents, regardless of their origin or implementation.

### Developer-First Experience

- Smart CLI: Intuitive commands with helpful prompts and validation
- Local Development: Built-in testing tools and mock agent networks
- Observable by Default: Structured logging, metrics, and tracing from day one
- Framework Agnostic: Works with your favorite AI frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, or vanilla implementations)
- Easily add skills, mcp agents, routing, handlers, and more
