## üöÄ About

**AutoWISP** is a Python package designed to allow users to automatically create and de-trend light curves from their astronomical data. It adheres to high standards of flexibility, reusability, and reliability, utilizing well-known software design patterns, including modular and hexagonal architectures. These patterns ensure the following benefits:

- **Modularity**: Different parts of the package can function independently, enhancing the package's modularity and allowing for easier maintenance and updates.
- **Testability**: Improved separation of concerns makes the code more testable.
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure and separation facilitate better management of the codebase.

## üìù How to Install

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install AutoWISP.

    pip install autowisp

## üìö Documentation

### Getting Started
Explore the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/tree/master/documentation).
In this guide, you will go step by step in the pipeline, producing the corresponding files needed for each step and ultimately creating light curves.

** See below for usage of each step, included is a configuration file to perform the tests.

To better understand the AutoWISP pipeline, we recommend visiting our [Documentation](https://github.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/tree/master/documentation) site.
There, you will find useful information about the individual steps, database, and/or browser-user-interface (currently under development).
