# Data Conversion Examples

Open World Agents provides conversion scripts to transform existing gaming and interaction datasets into the standardized OWAMcap format. This enables researchers to leverage existing datasets for training multimodal desktop agents.

!!! info "What are Data Conversions?"
    Data conversions transform existing gaming datasets (VPT, CS:GO, etc.) into the standardized OWAMcap format, enabling unified training across different games and interaction types.

## Why Convert to OWAMcap?

OWAMcap (Open World Agents MCAP) is a standardized format that:

- :material-merge: **Unifies multimodal data**: Combines video, keyboard, mouse, and metadata in a single format
- :material-database-sync: **Enables cross-dataset training**: Consistent format across different games and interaction types
- :material-flash: **Supports efficient streaming**: Optimized for real-time agent training and inference
- :material-clock-outline: **Preserves temporal relationships**: Maintains precise timing between visual and input events
