# Open World Agents Documentation

**A comprehensive framework for building AI agents that interact with desktop applications through vision, keyboard, and mouse control.**

Open World Agents (OWA) is a monorepo containing the complete toolkit for multimodal desktop agent development. From high-performance data capture to model training and real-time evaluation, everything is designed for flexibility and performance.

## Architecture Overview

OWA consists of four core components:

🌍 **[Environment (Env)](env/index.md)** - Asynchronous, event-driven interface for real-time agent interactions
📊 **[Data](data/index.md)** - High-performance recording, storage, and analysis of multimodal desktop data
📝 **[Messages](env/guide.md#message-registry)** - Centralized message definitions with automatic discovery and registry system
🤖 **[Examples](examples/)** - Complete implementations and training pipelines for multimodal agents

## Quick Navigation

### 🌍 Environment Framework
Build reactive desktop agents with our asynchronous environment system.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Core Concepts](env/index.md)** | `Callables`, `Listeners`, and `Runnables` for real-time processing |
| **[Environment Guide](env/guide.md)** | Zero-configuration plugin system and CLI tools |
| **[Custom Plugins](env/custom_plugins.md)** | Create your own environment extensions |

**Built-in Plugins:**  

- **[Desktop Environment](env/plugins/desktop.md)** - Mouse, keyboard, and window event handling
- **[GStreamer Environment](env/plugins/gst.md)** - High-performance screen capture (**6x faster** than alternatives)
- **[Standard Environment](env/plugins/std.md)** - Basic utilities and timing functions

### 📊 Data Infrastructure
Capture, store, and analyze multimodal desktop interaction data.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Data Overview](data/index.md)** | Complete data pipeline for desktop agents |
| **[OWAMcap Format](data/technical-reference/format-guide.md)** | Specialized format capturing complete desktop interactions (screen + events) with nanosecond precision |
| **[Desktop Recorder (ocap)](data/getting-started/recording-data.md)** | High-performance desktop recording tool |
| **[CLI Tools (owl)](owl_cli_reference.md)** | Command-line interface for data analysis and management |
| **[Data Viewer](data/tools/viewer.md)** | Visualize and analyze recorded sessions |
| **[Data Explorer](data/getting-started/exploring-data.md)** | Tools for data exploration and editing |

## What Can You Build?

**Anything that runs on desktop.** If a human can do it on a computer, you can build an AI agent to automate it:

🤖 **Desktop Automation** - Navigate applications, automate workflows, interact with any software  
🎮 **Game AI** - Master complex games through visual understanding and real-time decision making  
📊 **Training Datasets** - Capture high-quality human-computer interaction data for foundation models  
📈 **Benchmarks** - Create and evaluate desktop agent performance across diverse tasks
