# Introducing OWA's Env

**Open World Agents (OWA)** introduces **Env**, a groundbreaking modular agent system designed for dynamic, real-time environments. Say goodbye to rigid frameworks with fixed interfaces—Env's flexible architecture automatically discovers and loads components using Python's standard Entry Points system.

## Why Choose OWA's Env?

Traditional environmental interfaces like [gymnasium.Env](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/) fall short when it comes to building **real-time, real-world agents**. They rely on synchronous steps (`env.step()`, `env.reset()`), which assume your agent has infinite time to process actions. That's not realistic for agents that need to react instantly in dynamic environments.

**Env** changes the game with an event-driven, asynchronous design that mirrors real-world interactions. Here's what sets it apart:

- **Asynchronous Event Processing**: Leverage `Callables`, `Listeners`, and `Runnables` for real-time interaction. No more waiting for `env.step()`—the world doesn't stop, and neither should your agent. [Learn more...](guide.md)

- **Zero-Configuration Plugin System**: Plugins are automatically discovered via Entry Points when installed with `pip install`. No manual activation needed—components are immediately available with unified `namespace/name` patterns. Includes powerful CLI tools for plugin management. [Learn more...](guide.md)

- **Extensible, Open-Source Design**: Built for the community, by the community. Create plugins using Python packaging standards and share them easily. [Learn more...](custom_plugins.md)

## The Future is Real-Time

Time waits for no one—and neither do real-world agents. As we advance towards more responsive AI, agents must be capable of instantaneous reactions, just like humans. Env's architecture enables:

- **True Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple events simultaneously without bottlenecks.

- **Measured Reaction Times**: Agents operate within realistic timeframes, ensuring timely responses in dynamic settings.

We prioritize minimizing latency within the framework, aiming for agent reaction times that match or surpass human capabilities. Throughout our codebase, we ensure latency doesn't exceed **30ms**. Check out how we achieve this in our [Screen Listeners](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/owa-env-gst/owa/env/gst/screen/listeners.py#L88), and [Test Screen Listener](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/owa-env-gst/tests/test_screen_listener.py#L31).
