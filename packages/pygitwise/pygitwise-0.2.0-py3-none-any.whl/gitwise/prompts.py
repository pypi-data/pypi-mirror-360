{{file_content}}

MERGE CONTEXT: {{context}}

Please provide:

1. **SUMMARY**: A brief overview of what the conflict is about (1-2 sentences)

2. **OUR INTENT**: What the current branch was trying to accomplish with its changes

3. **THEIR INTENT**: What the incoming branch was trying to accomplish with its changes  

4. **SUGGESTED APPROACH**: The best strategy to resolve this conflict

5. **RESOLUTION STEPS**: Specific steps to manually resolve the conflict

Focus on understanding the PURPOSE and INTENT behind each change, not just the mechanical differences. Consider:
- What functionality each version is implementing
- Whether changes can be combined or if one should take precedence
- Any potential side effects or dependencies
- The broader context of what this code does

Provide practical, actionable guidance that helps the developer make an informed decision."""

# Commit Grouping Prompt
PROMPT_COMMIT_GROUPING = """You are a Git commit analysis expert. Analyze the provided staged changes and suggest how to group them into logical, cohesive commits.

STAGED CHANGES:
{{staged_changes}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the actual code changes, not just file paths
2. Group related functionality together (e.g., feature implementation + tests + docs)
3. Separate unrelated changes into different commits
4. Consider semantic relationships between changes
5. Aim for commits that tell a clear story about what was accomplished
6. Each group should represent a single logical unit of work

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "Short descriptive name for the group",
      "description": "What this group of changes accomplishes",
      "files": ["file1.py", "file2.py"],
      "suggested_commit_message": "feat: implement user authentication system",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these files belong together"
    }
  ],
  "recommendation": "single" or "multiple",
  "overall_description": "High-level summary of all the changes"
}

RULES:
- Only suggest multiple commits if the changes are truly unrelated
- Prefer fewer, more cohesive commits over many small ones
- Include all provided files in exactly one group
- Use conventional commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, etc.)
- Keep commit messages under 50 characters for the subject line
- If changes are closely related, recommend "single" commit
- Return only the JSON, no additional text or explanation
