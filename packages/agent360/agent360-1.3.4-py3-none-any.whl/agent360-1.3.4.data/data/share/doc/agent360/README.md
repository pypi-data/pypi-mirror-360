## Automatic Installation (All Linux Distributions)

You can install the default configuration of Agent360 on all Linux distributions with just one click.

1. Connect to your server via SSH.

2. Find your USERTOKEN. To do so, [go to the servers page](https://monitoring.platform360.io/servers/overview) and then click the "Add server" button.

3. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    wget -q -N https://monitoring.platform360.io/agent360.sh && bash agent360.sh USERTOKEN
    ```

## Automatic Installation (Windows)

Download the [setup](https://github.com/plesk/agent360/releases) and install it on your Windows server.

The installer will ask for your USERTOKEN which you can get [from the servers page](https://monitoring.platform360.io/servers/overview).

## Manual Installation

To customize installation options, install Agent360 manually.

1. Connect to your server via SSH.
2. Run the following command, which differs depending on your server platform:

    - Debian GNU/Linux:

        ```sh
        apt-get install python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip
        pip3 install agent360
        wget -O /etc/agent360.ini https://monitoring.platform360.io/agent360.ini
        ```

    - Fedora/CentOS version 6 or earlier (python 2.7):

        ```sh
        yum install python-devel python-setuptools gcc
        easy_install agent360 netifaces psutil
        wget -O /etc/agent360.ini https://monitoring.platform360.io/agent360.ini
        ```

    - Fedora/CentOS version 7 and later (python 3):

        ```sh
        yum install python36-devel python36 gcc
        pip3 install agent360
        wget -O /etc/agent360.ini https://monitoring.platform360.io/agent360.ini
        ```

3. Find your USERTOKEN. To do so, [go to the servers page](https://monitoring.platform360.io/servers/overview) and then click the "Add server" button. You need this to generate a serverid.

4. Run the following command (USERTOKEN is the one you got during the previous step):

    ```sh
    agent360 hello USERTOKEN /etc/agent360-token.ini
    ```

5. Create a systemd service at `/etc/systemd/system/agent360.service` by adding the following:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Agent360

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/agent360
    User=agent360

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

6. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/agent360.service
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable agent360
    systemctl start agent360
    ```
