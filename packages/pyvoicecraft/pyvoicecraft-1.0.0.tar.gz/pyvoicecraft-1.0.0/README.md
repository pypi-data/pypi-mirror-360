## Quick Start

### Basic Text-to-Speech

```python
from pyvoicecraft import speak

# Simple text-to-speech
speak("Hello, welcome to PyVoiceCraft!")

# With different voice
speak("This is a male voice", voice="male")
speak("This is a female voice", voice="female")
```

### Voice Recognition

```python
from pyvoicecraft import listen

# Listen for voice input
text = listen(timeout=5)
print(f"You said: {text}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from pyvoicecraft import PyVoiceCraft

# Create instance
ps = PyVoiceCraft()

# Set voice profile
ps.set_profile("female")

# Speak with custom settings
ps.speak("Hello world!", save_to_file="greeting.wav")

# Start conversation
def handle_response(text):
    return f"You said: {text}"

ps.start_conversation(callback=handle_response)
```

### Voice Profiles

```python
from pyvoicecraft import PyVoiceCraft, VoiceProfile

ps = PyVoiceCraft()

# Create custom profile
custom_profile = VoiceProfile(
    name="assistant",
    gender="female",
    age=25,
    accent="neutral",
    pitch=1.1,
    speed=1.2
)

ps.add_profile(custom_profile)
ps.set_profile("assistant")
ps.speak("Hello with custom voice profile!")
```

### Voice Commands

```python
from pyvoicecraft import PyVoiceCraft

ps = PyVoiceCraft()

# Add voice commands
def time_command(text):
    ps.speak_time()

def date_command(text):
    ps.speak_date()

ps.commands.add_command("time", time_command, ["what time", "current time"])
ps.commands.add_command("date", date_command, ["what date", "today"])

# Start listening for commands
ps.commands.start_listening()
```

### Audio Effects

```python
from pyvoicecraft import PyVoiceCraft

ps = PyVoiceCraft()

# Apply audio effects
effects = {
    "echo": {"delay_ms": 500, "decay": 0.3},
    "pitch": {"factor": 1.2},
    "speed": {"factor": 0.9}
}

ps.speak("This text has audio effects", effects=effects)
```
