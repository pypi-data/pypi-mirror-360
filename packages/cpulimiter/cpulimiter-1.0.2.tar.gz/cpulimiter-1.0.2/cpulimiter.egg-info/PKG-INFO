A simple, lightweight Python library for Windows to limit the CPU usage of any running process. Reduce CPU load, save power, and prevent overheating.

## 🤔 Why cpulimiter?

Have you ever had a program like `Google Chrome`, a game, or a background task consume 100% of your CPU, making your system unresponsive and your fans spin like a jet engine?

`cpulimiter` solves this by throttling the application, allowing you to specify exactly how much CPU it can use. This is perfect for:

- 🎮 Capping the CPU usage of games to prevent overheating.
- 🌐 Limiting resource-hungry browsers like Chrome or Edge when running multiple tabs.
- 💼 Running heavy data processing or video encoding tasks in the background without slowing down your machine.
- 🔋 Saving battery life on laptops by reducing the power consumption of demanding applications.
- 🤫 Quieting down noisy CPU fans.


## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Limit CPU Usage:** Throttle process CPU usage to a specific percentage.
- 🔍 **Flexible Targeting:** Target processes by Process ID (PID), executable name (`"chrome.exe"`), or even window title.
- 🤝 **Multi-Process Management:** Control and limit multiple processes at the same time.
- 🛠️ **Process Discovery:** Includes utility functions to find running applications and the active foreground window.
- 🕊️ **Lightweight:** Has a minimal performance footprint and no external dependencies.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install cpulimiter
```

## 📖 Quick Start

The following example limits all `chrome.exe` processes to just 5% of a single CPU core's power (a 95% limit).

```python
from cpulimiter import CpuLimiter
import time

# 1. Find all "chrome.exe" processes and limit them to 5% CPU.
# The limit is a percentage (0-100). 95 means "limit by 95%", so it can only use 5%.
limiter = CpuLimiter({"chrome.exe": 95})

# 2. The limiter is now running in the background.
# Let's keep it running for 15 seconds to see the effect.
print("Limiting Chrome's CPU usage for 15 seconds...")
time.sleep(15)

# 3. To stop limiting, simply call the shutdown() method.
limiter.shutdown()
print("CPU limit removed. Chrome is back to normal.")
```
*You can check your Task Manager to see the effect in real-time!*

## ⚙️ How It Works

`cpulimiter` works by rapidly suspending and resuming the threads of a target process. For example, to achieve a 50% CPU limit, the library suspends the process for 10 milliseconds and then resumes it for 10 milliseconds, effectively cutting its CPU time in half. This cycle is managed by a lightweight, high-precision background thread.

## 📚 Examples

Check out the `examples/` folder for more advanced use cases:

- **`basic_usage.py`** - A simple, manual introduction to the library's methods.
- **`simple_limit.py`** - Manually limit a list of specific applications.
- **`cpu_saver.py`** - An automatic CPU saver that throttles all applications that are not in the foreground.
- **`advanced_interactive.py`** - An interactive command-line tool for real-time process management.

## API Reference

### `CpuLimiter` Class

The primary class for managing process limits.

#### `limiter.add(pid, process_name, window_title_contains, limit_percentage)`

Adds a process to the limiter's management list.

- `pid` (int): The Process ID.
- `process_name` (str): The executable name (e.g., `"chrome.exe"`).
- `window_title_contains` (str): A substring to match in a window title.
- `limit_percentage` (int): The percentage by which to limit the CPU (e.g., `95` means the process can use up to 5% of a core).

#### `limiter.start(pid, process_name, window_title_contains)`

Starts the CPU limit on a specific, previously added process.

#### `limiter.stop(pid, process_name, window_title_contains)`

Stops the CPU limit on a specific process.

#### `limiter.start_all()`

Starts the CPU limit on all managed processes.

#### `limiter.stop_all()`

Stops the CPU limit on all managed processes.

### Utility Functions

#### `get_active_window_info()`

Returns a dictionary containing the `pid`, `name`, and `title` of the foreground window.

#### `get_active_app_pids()`

Returns a dictionary of all processes with visible windows, mapping their PIDs to their executable names.
