**`yojenkins`** is a cross-platform command line interface (CLI) tool to monitor, manage, and deal with Jenkins server. It makes it possible to interact with a Jenkins server without using the browser based Jenkins UI.

This tool is able to be integrated into a script as middleware in order to automate Jenkins related tasks or enable Jenkins configuration as code.

**`yojenkins` will liberate you and your browser from the Jenkins Web UI**

With **`yojenkins`** you can manage:

- **Authentication**: _Authentication structure similar to AWS API_
- **Server**: _Create, shutdown, view queue, and more_
- **User accounts**: _Create, delete, add/remove permission, and more_
- **Nodes/agents:** _Create, delete, shut down server, and more_
- **Credentials**: _Create, update, delete, list, and more_
- **Folders:** _Create items, delete items, disable, enable, and more_
- **Jobs:** _Create, delete, trigger, monitor, search, and more_
- **Builds:** _Monitor, abort, tail logs, follow logs, and more_
- **Stages:** _Get info, get logs, view steps, view status_
- **Steps:** _Get info_
- **Other tools and functions:** _Run groovy scripts remotely, run custom REST calls, setup a shared library, view command usage history, and more_
