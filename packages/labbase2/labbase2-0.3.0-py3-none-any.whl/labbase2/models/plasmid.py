    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        The internal ID of this plasmis. The ID is unique among ALL entities
        in the datbase.
    insert : str
        The name of the insert. As explained for 'vector' a plasmid should be fully
        defined by the vector and the insert.
    vector : str
        The vector that was used for cloning. Usually, cloning means transferring an
        insert into a specific vector. By giving both the vector and the insert the
        plasmid should be fully defined.
    cloning_date : Date
        The date the plasmid was first created. This usually corresponds to the day
        of ligation.
    description : str
        A precise definition of the plasmid: What is it and what is it for. You may
        also give further information on how the plasmid was made.
    reference : str
        If the plasmid is published or was used somewhere it is possible to enter the
        DOI here.
    preparations : list[Preparation]
        A list of all preparations that were done of this plasmid.
    glycerol_stocks : list[GlycerolStock]
        A list of bacterial stocks that carry this plasmid.

    Notes
    -----
    As most other classes Plasmid inherits from Entity and therefor has three
    additional attributes: 'comments', 'files', and 'requests'. See 'Entity' for
    further explanations.
