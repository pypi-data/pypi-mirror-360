    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        An internal identifier of the person.
    first_name : str
        The person's given name.
    last_name : str
        The person's last name.
    email : str
        The email address.
    password_hash : str
        This is a hash of the password set by the user. This attribute is not set
        manually. Instead, the clear password is passed to the 'set_password' method.
    file_picture_id : int
        ID of a file serving as the profile picture.
    timestamp_created : Datetime
        The time the profile was created. Automatically set by the database.
    timestamp_last_login : Datetime
        Time of last log in.
    timezone : str
        Preferred timezone to show all times in.
    is_active : bool
        A logical flag indicating if the user is active. If `False` the user can no
        longer sign in to the application.
    is_admin : bool
        A logical flag indicating if the user is an admin. Admins can do everything
        in the application.
    picture : File
        The `File` instance for the profile picture.
    comments : list[Comment]
        A list of all comments that were created by this person.
    plasmids : list[Plasmid]
        A list of all plasmids owned by this user.
    glycerol_stocks : list[GlycerolStock]
        A list of all glycerol stocks owned by this user.
    oligonucleotides : list[Oligonucleotide]
        A list of all oligonucleotides owned by this user. NOTE: This was previously
        called 'primers' but oligonucleotide is more accurate.
    preparations : list[Preparation]
        All plasmid preparations done by this user. This can be different than the
        owner of the plasmid to which the preparation belongs.
    dilutions : list[Dilution]
        A list of antibody dilutions determined by this person.
    files : list[BaseFile]
        All files uploaded by this person.
    modifications : list[Modification]
        All modifications of fly stocks done by this user. This can be different from
        the owner of the fly stock.
    fly_stocks : list[FlyStock]
        A list of all fly stocks owned by this user.
    responsibilities : list[Chemical]
        All chemicals for which this user is responsible.
    stock_solutions : list[StockSolution]
        All stock solutions prepared by this user.
    import_jobs : list[ImportJob]
        A list of all import jobs of this user.
    resets : list[ResetPassword]
        A list of reset requests for the password made by this person. The database
        scheme theoretically allows to have several such resets active for one user
        but the application should make sure to delete any previous request for a new
        password once another request is started.
    permissions : list[Permission]
        Roles of this user. The set of roles determines hat a user can see and do in
        the application.


    Notes
    -----
    A person is ultimately identified by its id, which is used internally for
    everything. However, for convenience a user can login to the app using his/her
    email address. Therefore, the email address has to be unique among all users. The
    same applies to the username.

    Users inherit from the UserMixin class of the flask_login module. The roles
    system is self-implemented in the app.utils module via a simple decorator.
