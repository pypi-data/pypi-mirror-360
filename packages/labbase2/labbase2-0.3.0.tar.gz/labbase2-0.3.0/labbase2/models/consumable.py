    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        The internal database identifier of this batch.
    consumable_id : int
        The identifier of the consumable to which this batch belongs.
    supplier : str
        The company (or whatever) where this batch was ordered (again, the same
        chemical might be ordered at different companies due to discounts,
        for instance).
    article_number : str
        The article number of the ordered consumable. This serves as a unambiguous
        identifier of the ordered chemical. This is important for different quality
        grades of the same chemical, for instance.
    amount : str
        The amoint that was ordered. For some companies this is already indicated by
        the article number but for some is not. The information is straightforward
        for chemicals. For enzymes this might be the number of reactions or the total
        activity in U. For antibodies the total volume along with the concentration
        would suffice.
    date_ordered : date
        The date at which this batch was ordered.
    date_opened : date
        The date at which this batch was opened.
    date_expiration : date
        The expiration date that was set by the supplier.
    date_emptied : date
        The date at which this batch was emptied.
    price : float
        The price in euros.
    storage_place : str
        The location where this batch can be found. This should be clear and
        unambiguous.
    lot : str
        The lot number of this batch.
    in_use : bool
        A flag indicating if this batch is currently in use. At best, only ever one
        batch for each consumable is in use at a time.
    is_open : bool
        A flag indicating if this batch was opened already.
    is_empty : bool
        A flag indicating if this batch is empty.

    Notes
    -----
    While a consumable is just a description a batch is the actual thing available in
    the lab. For instance, an entry for the chemical 'SDS' only gives general
    informations about the chemical and that it is or was available in the lab at
    some point in time. However, a batch is the actual order of that consumable
    along with additional informations that might be of interest like article number
    and source (the same chemical might be bought from different manufacturers).
