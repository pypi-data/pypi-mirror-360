    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        The identifier of this entity. This ID is unique among all fly stocks,
        primer, antibodies, etc.
    label : str
        A string naming the entity. This must be unique among all entities and is
        supposed to be more human accessible than the ID.
    timestamp_created : DatetTime
        The time this entity was added to the database. This is not to be set by the
        user but will be set by the database.
    timestamp_edited : DatetTime
        The time this entity was last edited. Can be `None` if the entity was never
        modified. Update will automatically be triggered by the application and set
        by the database.
    owner_id : int
        The user ID of the person who imported this entity.
    origin : str
        A short string describing how the entity was added to the database.
    entity_type : str
        The type of the instance. This is needed for proper mapping in the database
        and setting up inheritance.
    comments : list[Comment]
        A list of all comments that were created for this entity.
    files : list[File]
        A list of all files that are attached to this entity. Note that some models
        feature additional files like plasmid maps for `Plasmid`. These file swill
        not be included in this list.
    requests : list[Request]
        A list of all requests that were made for this entity.

    Notes
    -----
    This base class allows that every child has a comments and files as well as a
    requests attribute that is stored in a single table in the final database. The
    inheritance is implemented as joined inheritance. That means that there is one
    table in the database for all entities with file_columns common to all children
    (those defined in this class) and one table for each child with file_columns
    specific to the respective class. Therefore, instances of child classes can only
    be constructed from the database by joining several tables.
