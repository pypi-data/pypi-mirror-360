class Chemical(Consumable):
    """A class to represent a chemical compound.

    Currently, a Chemical has only very few attributes, i.e., two: The CAS
    number and the PubChem CID. The CID is used to retrieve further
    informations from the web. The CAS number is sued for 'official' reference.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        The internal ID of this chemical. This is unique among all entities
        in the database.
    responsible_id : int
        ID of the user who is responsible for this chemical.
    cas_number : str
        The CAS registry number, a mandatory number for all chemical compounds.
    pubchem_cid : int
        The PubChem reference number. This will be used to retrieve
        additional informations about this compound from PubChem.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently, the Chemical class uses the PubChem CID to retrieve
    information like the molecular weight from the PubChem REST API. This
    causes problems at the moment. These problems might be caused of people
    requesting too much information in too little time followed by banning the IP
    by PubChem. Therefor, it is likely that the implementation will change in
    the future such that people have to add specific information about the
    chemical themselves.
