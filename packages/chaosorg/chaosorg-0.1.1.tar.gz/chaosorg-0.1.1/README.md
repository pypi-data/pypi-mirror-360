# chaosorg

Organize messy project folders with one simple command.

---

## üìÅ What does it do?

`chaosorg` automatically organizes files in your project directory based on file types. It sorts files into folders like:

* `scripts/`
* `notebooks/`
* `data/`
* `models/`
* `docs/`
* `outputs/`

This keeps your project tidy, easy to navigate, and collaboration-ready.

## üîç How Files Are Sorted

| Folder       | Extensions                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `scripts/`   | `.py`                          |
| `notebooks/` | `.ipynb`                       |
| `data/`      | `.csv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`        |
| `models/`    | `.pkl`, `.joblib`, `.h5`       |
| `docs/`      | `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx` |
| `outputs/`   | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`        |

You can customize these rules by editing `FOLDER_MAP` in the source code.
