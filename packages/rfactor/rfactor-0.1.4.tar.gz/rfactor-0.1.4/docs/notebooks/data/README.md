## Data for the analysis Belgium

The data in this folder are part of the initial project to provide erosivity factors for Belgium.

Whereas the full input data is not made avaiable, the resulting erosivity factors are provided in this folder: `erosivity_belgium.csv`.

In order to reproduce the analysis, the stations/years used as input are enlisted in the file `files.csv`.

The station metadata (location coordinates) of the stations used are enlisted in the `stations.csv` file.
