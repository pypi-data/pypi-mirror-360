Hooks
"""""

Introduced in `ligo!71 <https://git.ligo.org/asimov/asimov/-/merge_requests/71>`_, asimov now allows plugins to interact with the monitor loop, and gain access to the ledger once the monitoring process has completed.
It also allows external packages to provide new data via the `asimov apply` interface.

ROQ bases in bilby
""""""""""""""""""

This version introduces support for ROQ bases in bilby.

Major New Features
-------------------

Projects
""""""""

This version of asimov represents a major update compared to the previously released versions of asimov.
In the past asimov has relied on gitlab issue trackers in order to organise a project.
In this version we introduce infrastructure within asimov to enable management of much smaller projects as well as those asimov was initially intended for.
Projects can now be created in a user's home directory and used to organise and automate multiple runs.

Pipeline interface improvements
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We've made a serious effort in this version to improve the interface between asimov and various gravitational wave analysis pipelines, including Bayeswave, bilby, and lalinference.
We've made it much easier to use other pipelines with asimov too, which can now be implemented as plugins without requiring upstream changes to the asimov codebase.

Reporting improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""

We've introduced a number of new features to the report pages which are created by asimov in order to give a more useful overview of all of the analyses which are being run.

Command-line interface
""""""""""""""""""""""

Asimov now has a cleaner, and more consistent command line interface, which has been renamed ``asimov``.
When we started work on the project we weren't sure how asimov would be used, but we've come to the conclusion that having everything named consistently is for the best.

Blueprint files
"""""""""""""""

Setting up events and analyses in asimov requires a large amount of information.
To assist with this, asimov is now able to read-in this information in yaml-format files which we call "blueprints".
A curated collection of these for the events included in the GWTC catalogues, and the analyses used for those catalogues are available from https://git.ligo.org/asimov/data.
