BayesWave pipelines
===================

The BayesWave interface allows asimov to configure and monitor analyses using BayesWave.
BayesWave is frequently used as the first analysis of an event in order to generate the on-source PSD estimates for subsequent analyses.

Review Status
-------------

.. note::
   The current integration with BayesWave is fully reviewed and is suitable for use with all collaboration analyses.

Examples
--------

BayesWave on-source PSD Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was the default analysis setup for the O3 catalog runs which were used in the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 catalog papers.

Ledger Options
--------------

The Bayeswave pipeline interface looks for the the sections and values listed below in addition to the information which is required for analysing *all* gravitational wave events such as the locations of calibration envelopes and data.


``quality``
~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings specifically relate to data quality related settings.

``segment start``
  The start time of the segment.
  If not specified, the start time of the segment is determined by subtracting the ``quality>segment length`` setting from the ``event time``, and adding 2 (that is, the event time is placed two seconds from the end of the segment.


``sampler``
~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings relate specifically to the sampling process used in Bayeswave.

``iterations``
  The number of iterations to be carried out.

``scheduler``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings relate specifically to the accounting and scheduling of the job.

``memory``
  The amount of memory to request.

``post memory``
  The amount of memory to request for post-processing.

``accounting group``
  The group to use for accounting.
