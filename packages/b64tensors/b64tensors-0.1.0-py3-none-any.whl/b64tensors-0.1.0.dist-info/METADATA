              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

print(encoded)  # float32##(100,200)##<base64_data>

# Decode back to tensor
decoded = b64tensors.decode(encoded)
print(torch.equal(tensor, decoded))  # True
```

#### `encode(tensor: torch.Tensor) -> str`

Encode a PyTorch tensor as a base64 string.

**Parameters:**
- `tensor`: The PyTorch tensor to encode

**Returns:**
- Base64-encoded string in format: `<data_type>##<shape>##<b64_encoded_data>`

**Example:**
```python
tensor = torch.randn(10, 20, dtype=torch.float32)
encoded = b64tensors.encode(tensor)
```

#### `decode(encoded_str: str) -> torch.Tensor`

Decode a base64-encoded tensor string back to a PyTorch tensor.

**Parameters:**
- `encoded_str`: The base64-encoded tensor string

```

#### `encode_dict(tensor_dict: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]) -> Dict[str, str]`

Encode a dictionary of PyTorch tensors as base64 strings.

**Parameters:**
- `tensor_dict`: Dictionary mapping keys to PyTorch tensors

**Returns:**
- Dictionary mapping the same keys to base64-encoded tensor strings

**Example:**
```python
tensors = {
    "weights": torch.randn(10, 20),
    "biases": torch.randn(20)
}
encoded_dict = b64tensors.encode_dict(tensors)
```

#### `decode_dict(encoded_dict: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`

Decode a dictionary of base64-encoded tensor strings back to PyTorch tensors.

**Parameters:**
- `encoded_dict`: Dictionary mapping keys to base64-encoded tensor strings

**Returns:**
- Dictionary mapping the same keys to decoded PyTorch tensors

**Example:**
```python
decoded_dict = b64tensors.decode_dict(encoded_dict)
```

## Supported Data Types

- `torch.float16` - 16-bit floating point
- `torch.float32` - 32-bit floating point

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Model Weights

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import b64tensors

# Create a simple model
model = nn.Linear(784, 10)

# Encode all model parameters
encoded_weights = b64tensors.encode_dict(dict(model.named_parameters()))

# Save to file or send over network
with open('model_weights.txt', 'w') as f:
    for name, encoded_tensor in encoded_weights.items():
        f.write(f"{name}: {encoded_tensor}\n")

# Later, decode the weights
decoded_weights = b64tensors.decode_dict(encoded_weights)

# Load back into model
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    param.data = decoded_weights[name]
```

### Batch Processing

```python
import torch
import b64tensors

# Process multiple tensors
tensors = [
    torch.randn(100, 200, dtype=torch.float32),
    torch.randint(0, 10, (50, 50), dtype=torch.int32),
    torch.randn(3, 224, 224, dtype=torch.float16)
]

# Encode all tensors
encoded_tensors = [b64tensors.encode(t) for t in tensors]

# Decode all tensors
decoded_tensors = [b64tensors.decode(e) for e in encoded_tensors]

# Verify they match
for original, decoded in zip(tensors, decoded_tensors):
    assert torch.equal(original, decoded)
```

## Error Handling

The package provides comprehensive error handling:

```python
import b64tensors

try:
    # Invalid format
    b64tensors.decode("invalid_format")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

try:
    # Unsupported dtype
    tensor = torch.complex(torch.randn(5, 5), torch.randn(5, 5))
    b64tensors.encode(tensor)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
