### Example Claude Desktop Sessions

#### Building a New MCP Server
```
You: "Help me build an MCP server for file processing with CSV and JSON support."

Claude Desktop automatically:
1. 🎯 Calls track_development_session_tool("file-processing-mcp", "Building CSV/JSON tools")
2. 🔍 Uses check_before_build_tool to see if similar tools exist
3. 💡 Calls suggest_next_action_tool for personalized guidance
4. 📊 Tracks progress as you build each tool
```

#### Avoiding Duplicate Work
```
You: "I want to add a data validation tool to my project."

Claude Desktop automatically:
1. 🔍 Scans existing tools with scan_project_files_tool
2. ⚠️  Alerts if similar validation tools already exist
3. 💡 Suggests reusing or extending existing tools instead
4. 🎯 Tracks the decision in your development session
```

#### Getting Development Insights
```
You: "What should I work on next for my MCP project?"

Claude Desktop automatically:
1. 📊 Calls get_session_analytics_tool for project insights
2. 💡 Uses suggest_next_action_tool based on current state
3. 🎯 Provides personalized recommendations
4. 📈 Shows development patterns and progress
```

### Benefits of Claude Desktop + mcp4mcp

- **🧠 Intelligent Context**: Claude Desktop understands MCP development patterns
- **🔍 Automatic Conflict Detection**: Prevents duplicate tool development
- **📊 Continuous Tracking**: Every development action is logged automatically
- **💡 Contextual Suggestions**: AI guidance based on your specific project state
- **🚀 Accelerated Development**: Focus on building, not project management

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Start Development Session

```python
# Log what you're working on
await track_development_session(
    "Building file processing tools", 
    "my_project",
    "csv_reader"
)
```

### Check Before Building

```python
# Avoid duplicates
result = await check_before_build(
    "file_processor", 
    "Process CSV files",
    "my_project" 
)

if result['conflicts']:
    print("⚠️ Similar tools exist - consider reusing instead")
```

### Get AI Suggestions
