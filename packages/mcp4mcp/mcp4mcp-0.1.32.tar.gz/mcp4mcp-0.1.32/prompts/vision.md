# Meta MCP Server Vision & Design

## The Problem

When building MCP servers with LLMs, each conversation starts fresh. You lose track of what tools already exist, what’s been tried, and what should be built next. This leads to duplicate work and inefficient development.

## The Solution

A **Meta MCP Server** that serves as persistent memory and development intelligence for MCP projects. It doesn’t build code - other MCPs handle that. Instead, it tracks project state and provides smart guidance across conversations.

## Core Goals

1. **Prevent Duplication**: Stop rebuilding tools that already exist
1. **Promote Evolution**: Suggest extending existing tools over creating new ones
1. **Maintain Context**: Remember project state between conversations
1. **Guide Development**: AI-powered recommendations for what to work on next

## Essential Tools (7 Total)

### State Management

- **`get_project_state`**: Returns current tool inventory and project status
- **`update_project_state`**: Records changes made during development
- **`scan_project_files`**: Syncs stored state with actual project files

### Development Intelligence

- **`check_before_build`**: Prevents duplication by checking existing tools
- **`suggest_next_action`**: AI-powered recommendations using LLM callbacks

### Progress Tracking

- **`update_tool_status`**: Tracks tool implementation progress and issues
- **`track_development_session`**: Logs what was accomplished each session

## Typical Conversation Flow

1. Start: `get_project_state()` → “What do I have?”
1. Plan: `suggest_next_action()` → “What should I work on?”
1. Check: `check_before_build()` → “Does this already exist?”
1. Build: Use other MCPs to implement
1. Record: `update_project_state()` → “Remember what I built”
1. End: `track_development_session()` → “Log this session”

## Key Design Principles

- **Persistence First**: Maintain state across conversations
- **Intelligence Where It Matters**: AI reasoning only in `suggest_next_action`
- **Reality Sync**: Handle drift between stored state and actual files
- **Conversation-Aware**: Tools match natural development conversation patterns

This creates a development companion that makes every MCP building session smarter and more efficient by providing complete project memory and intelligent guidance.
