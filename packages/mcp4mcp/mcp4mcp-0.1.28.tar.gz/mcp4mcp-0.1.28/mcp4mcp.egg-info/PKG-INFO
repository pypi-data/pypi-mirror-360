## 📋 Usage Examples

### Start Development Session

```python
# Log what you're working on
await track_development_session(
    "Building file processing tools", 
    "my_project",
    "csv_reader"
)
```

### Check Before Building

```python
# Avoid duplicates
result = await check_before_build(
    "file_processor", 
    "Process CSV files",
    "my_project" 
)

if result['conflicts']:
    print("⚠️ Similar tools exist - consider reusing instead")
```

### Get AI Suggestions

```python
# Get personalized guidance
suggestions = await suggest_next_action(
    "my_project",
    "Just finished the CSV reader, what's next?"
)

for suggestion in suggestions['suggestions']:
    print(f"💡 {suggestion}")
```

### Auto-Discover Tools

```python
# Scan your codebase
result = await scan_project_files("my_project", "./src")
print(f"🔍 Found {result['new_tools']} new tools")
```

## 🤖 AI-Powered MCP Development

Use this prompt template with any LLM to build MCP servers that leverage mcp4mcp:

```markdown
# MCP Server Development with mcp4mcp

You are an expert MCP (Model Context Protocol) developer building a new MCP server. 
You have access to mcp4mcp tools that provide intelligent development assistance.

## Your Development Process:

1. **Start Each Session**: Always begin by calling `track_development_session_tool` 
   to log what you're working on

2. **Before Building Any Tool**: Call `check_before_build_tool` to check for 
   conflicts and similar existing tools

3. **Get AI Guidance**: Use `suggest_next_action_tool` for personalized 
   development recommendations based on project state

4. **Update Progress**: Use `update_project_state_tool` to track tools as you 
   build them (planned → in_progress → completed)

5. **Discover Existing Tools**: Use `scan_project_files_tool` to automatically 
   find tools in the codebase

6. **Check for Duplicates**: Run `analyze_tool_similarity_tool` periodically 
   to find similar tools that could be consolidated

## Current Task:
Build a [DOMAIN] MCP server with tools for [SPECIFIC_FUNCTIONALITY].

## Project Details:
- Project name: [PROJECT_NAME]
- Description: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION] 
- Key requirements: [LIST_REQUIREMENTS]

Start by calling the appropriate mcp4mcp tools to understand the current state 
and get AI-powered suggestions for the best approach.
