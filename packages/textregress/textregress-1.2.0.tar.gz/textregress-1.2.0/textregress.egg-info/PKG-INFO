## Installation

TextRegress requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install textregress
```

Or install from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinhangjiang/textregress.git
cd textregress
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
from textregress import TextRegressor

# Create sample data
data = {
    'text': [
        "This is a positive review about the product.",
        "The quality is excellent and I recommend it.",
        "Not satisfied with the purchase.",
        "Great value for money."
    ],
    'y': [4.5, 4.8, 2.1, 4.2],
    'feature1': [1.0, 1.2, 0.8, 1.1],
    'feature2': [0.5, 0.6, 0.3, 0.7]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create and train the model
regressor = TextRegressor(
    model_name="lstm",  # or "gru"
    encoder_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    exogenous_features=["feature1", "feature2"],
    max_steps=100
)

# Fit and predict
predictions = regressor.fit_predict(df)
print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
```

## Implementation

TextRegress Model (encoder_model, encoder_params=None, rnn_type, rnn_layers, hidden_size, bidirectional,  
    inference_layer_units, exogenous_features=None, feature_mixer=False, learning_rate: float, 
    loss_function: Union[str, Callable], encoder_output_dim: int, optimizer_name: str, optimizer_params: dict=None,  
    cross_attention_enabled: bool=False, cross_attention_layer: Optional[nn.Module]=None, dropout_rate: float=0.0,  
    se_layer: bool=True, random_seed: int=1)

**Parameters:**

- **encoder_model**: *str*  
  Specifies the pretrained encoder model to use. This can be a HuggingFace model identifier (e.g., `"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`) or `"tfidf"` for a TFIDF-based encoder.

- **encoder_params**: *Optional[dict]*  
  A dictionary of additional parameters for configuring the encoder. For example, when using a TFIDF encoder, users can supply parameters such as `{"max_features": 1000, "ngram_range": (1, 2)}`. These parameters are passed directly to the underlying encoder.

- **rnn_type**: *str*  
  Specifies the type of recurrent unit to use. Acceptable values include `"LSTM"` and `"GRU"`. This choice determines the basic building block of the temporal processing module.

- **rnn_layers**: *int*  
  The number of stacked RNN layers in the model. More layers can capture higher-order temporal features but may require more data and computation.

- **hidden_size**: *int*  
  The number of hidden units in each RNN layer. This parameter defines the dimensionality of the hidden state and directly influences the model’s capacity.

- **bidirectional**: *bool*  
  When set to `True`, the RNN operates in a bidirectional manner, processing the sequence in both forward and backward directions. This effectively doubles the output dimension of the RNN.

- **inference_layer_units**: *int*  
  The number of units in the intermediate inference (fully connected) layer. This layer transforms the processed features into a representation suitable for the final regression output.

- **exogenous_features**: *Optional[List[str]]*  
  A list of column names representing additional (exogenous) features to be incorporated into the model.  
  - When `cross_attention_enabled` is `True`, these features are projected to match the RNN output dimension and integrated via a cross-attention mechanism.  
  - When `cross_attention_enabled` is `False` and `feature_mixer` is also `False`, the normalized exogenous features are directly concatenated with the document embedding.  
  - When `feature_mixer` is `True`, the model first computes an inference output from the document embedding and then mixes in the normalized exogenous features via an additional mixing layer before making predictions.

- **feature_mixer**: *bool*  
  A flag to enable additional mixing of exogenous features. When set to `True`, the model mixes normalized exogenous features with the inference output of the document embedding via a dedicated linear layer. When `False`, the exogenous features are concatenated directly with the document embedding.

- **learning_rate**: *float*  
  The learning rate used by the optimizer during training. This controls how quickly the model weights are updated.

- **loss_function**: *Union[str, Callable]*  
  Specifies the loss function for training. Supported string options include `"mae"`, `"mse"`, `"rmse"`, `"smape"`, `"wmape"`, and `"mape"`. Alternatively, users can provide a custom loss function as a callable. Custom loss functions must accept keyword arguments `pred` and `target`.

- **encoder_output_dim**: *int*  
  The dimensionality of the vector output from the encoder module. This value is used to configure the input size of the RNN. For instance, when using a TFIDF encoder, this is automatically set based on the size of the fitted vocabulary.

- **optimizer_name**: *str*  
  The name of the optimizer to be used (e.g., `"adam"`, `"sgd"`, etc.). The model dynamically searches within PyTorch’s optimizers to instantiate the specified optimizer.

- **optimizer_params**: *dict*  
  A dictionary containing additional keyword parameters to pass to the optimizer upon instantiation (for example, momentum for SGD).

- **cross_attention_enabled**: *bool*  
  A flag indicating whether to enable a cross-attention mechanism. When `True`, the model generates a global token (by averaging the RNN outputs) and uses it as the query to attend over the projected exogenous features. The output of this attention is concatenated with the RNN’s last time-step output before further processing.

- **cross_attention_layer**: *Optional[nn.Module]*  
  An optional custom cross-attention layer. If not provided and cross attention is enabled, a default single-head MultiheadAttention layer (from `nn.MultiheadAttention`) is used.

- **dropout_rate**: *float*  
  The dropout rate applied after each major component (e.g., after the RNN output, global token generation, inference layers, cross-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation block). A value of 0.0 means no dropout is applied.

- **se_layer**: *bool*  
  Specifies whether to enable the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block on the output of the inference layer. When enabled, the SE block recalibrates channel-wise feature responses, potentially enhancing model performance.

- **random_seed**: *int*  
  Sets the random seed for reproducibility. This value is used to initialize PyTorch (via `torch.manual_seed`), ensuring that training results are consistent across runs.
