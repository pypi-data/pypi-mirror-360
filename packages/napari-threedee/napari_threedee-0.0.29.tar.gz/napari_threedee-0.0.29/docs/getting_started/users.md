# Getting started for users

If you would like to get started using the napari-threedee plugins, we recommend reviewing the following documentation:

- We have created tutorials in the "How to..." section. For example, read about [how to interactively position a render plane](https://napari-threedee.github.io/how_to/render_plane_manipulator/)
- [Gallery of examples of plugins that depend on `napari-threedee`](https://napari-threedee.github.io/generated/gallery/).
