will all carriers, and will be the default file obtained with the

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

By default, all carriers are included in the global manifest. To remove
one:

- Go to Inventory / Configuration / Shipping Methods
- Select the carrier you don't want to include in the manifest
- Unmark the "Include In Global Manifest" checkbox

Usage
=====

To print the global manifest, you need to:

- Go to Inventory / Operations / Manifest
- Toggle the "Global Manifest Query" button
- Select the date
- Click the "Get Manifest File" button, then download the file

A delivery (picking) will be included in the global manifest only if all
of the following conditions are met:

- Included carrier: The delivery has a carrier marked with "Include in
  Global Manifest".
- Done date: The date_done of the picking is within the selected date
  range in the wizard.
- State: The delivery is in "Done" state.
- Operation type: Only outgoing deliveries are considered (picking type
  = outgoing).
