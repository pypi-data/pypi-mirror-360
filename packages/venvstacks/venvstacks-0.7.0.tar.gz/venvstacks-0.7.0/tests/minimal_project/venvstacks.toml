# Minimal Python runtime, framework and application layers for venvstacks testing

# See `sample_project` for a more complex environment build that covers more features.
# This minimal project is aimed at testing features like archive tagging and framework
# dependency resolution, where the actual content of the layers doesn't matter,
# the environments just need to exist.
