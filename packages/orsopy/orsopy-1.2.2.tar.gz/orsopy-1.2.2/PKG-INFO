orsopy is a Python library that implements ORSO functionality, which currently includes the `reduced data file format`_.
The orsopy package is used by a range of data reduction and analysis packages for the writing and reading of reduced reflectometry data. 
This data is written following the `ORSO defined specification`_, enabling a metadata-rich and flexible file to be created. 

`ORSO`_ is an open organisation aimed at improving the scientific techniques of neutron and X-ray reflectometry. 
In the interest of transparency, all minutes from orsopy developer meetings are available in the `Documents`_ in the sidebar of this page. 
If you are interested in getting involved in developing orsopy, please feel free to `contribute`_ or get in touch on the `ORSO Slack`_ (where there is a channel dedicated to orsopy).
