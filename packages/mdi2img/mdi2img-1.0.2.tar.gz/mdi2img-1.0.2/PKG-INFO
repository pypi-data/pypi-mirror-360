# MDI2TIFF

This is a python library/program the piggybacks of the MDI2TIFF binary created by Microsoft in order to help you, convert, view, save (under another image format), mdi file using python

## For non windows users

This library depends on the official "Microsoft Office Document Imaging" software, thus, a windows 32bit application.

For this library to work, you need :

1. To install wine on your computer
2. Set wine to 32bit mode
3. Make sure mono is installed

Or, you could have docker installed on the user's computer and use the image provided, come features of the program will not be available (i.e. visualisation) but the convertion (the core of the app) will.

Current status of the docker: Unstable, wine is still being set up.
