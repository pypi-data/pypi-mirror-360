# Book Strands

A powerful CLI tool for managing e-book metadata and organizing your digital library.

## Overview

Book Strands is designed to help you manage your e-book collection by providing tools to read, modify, and organize e-book metadata. It supports popular e-book formats and can automatically organize your files based on author, series, and other metadata.

## Features

- **Read metadata** from e-books including title, author, series info, and ISBN
- **Write/modify metadata** in your e-books
- **Organize your library** by automatically renaming and moving files based on customizable patterns
- **Support for multiple formats**: EPUB, MOBI, AZW and AZW3
- **Intelligent processing** using AI-powered tools to manage your collection

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install book-strands
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) installed

## Usage

```bash
book-strands run /path/to/your/ebooks /path/to/organized/library \
  --output-format "{{author}}/{{series}}/{{title}}.{{extension}}"
```

Output format can be described in plain language as it is an interpreted format.

You can also import and organize existing e-book files:

```bash
book-strands import-local-books /path/to/existing/books /path/to/organized/library
```

## Configuration

Book Strands uses a configuration file located at `~/.config/book-strands.conf`. Here's an example configuration:

```ini
[zlib-logins]
user1@example.com = password1
user2@example.com = password2
```

The `zlib-logins` section contains email and password pairs for Z-Library accounts used for downloading books.

## Local LLMs

You can also use any local (or remote) Ollama-hosted LLM by setting `--ollama` and configuring it with the below parameters:

```bash
--ollama-model TEXT   Ollama model to use  [default: qwen3:8b]
--ollama-url TEXT     Ollama server URL  [default: http://localhost:11434]
```
