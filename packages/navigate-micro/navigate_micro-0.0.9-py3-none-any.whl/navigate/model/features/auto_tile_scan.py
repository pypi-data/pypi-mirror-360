class CalculateFocusRange:
    """CalculateFocusRange class for determining the focus range using autofocus.

    This class provides functionality to calculate the focus range of a microscope
    using autofocus measurements.

    Notes:
    ------
    - This class is used to calculate the focus range of a microscope by utilizing
    autofocus measurements. It provides methods for different stages of the
    calculation process.

    - The `config_table` attribute is a dictionary that defines the configuration for
    each stage of the calculation process, including initialization, main execution,
    and finalization steps.

    - The autofocus measurements are performed using an instance of the `Autofocus`
    class, which is initialized with the same `model` object used for focus range
    calculation.

    - The focus range calculation involves signal acquisition and data acquisition
    stages, which are controlled using the provided methods.

    - The `CalculateFocusRange` class can be used to automate the process of
    determining the optimal focus range for microscopy experiments.
