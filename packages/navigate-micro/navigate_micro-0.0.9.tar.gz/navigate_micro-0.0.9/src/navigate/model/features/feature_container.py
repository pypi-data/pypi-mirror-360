class TreeNode:
    """
    TreeNode class for representing a node in a control sequence tree.

    This class represents a node in a control sequence tree used for controlling the
    behavior of a microscope or similar device. Each node has a name, associated
    functions, and properties that define its behavior in the control sequence.

    Notes:
    ------
    - This class is used to represent nodes in a control sequence tree where each node
      corresponds to a feature or action in the control sequence.

    - The `node_funcs` attribute contains a dictionary of functions associated with this
      node, which are executed in response to specific signals or events.

    - The `node_type` attribute specifies whether the node is a 'one-step' node or a
      'multi-step' node.

    - The `device_related` attribute indicates whether the node is related to device
      control.

    - The `need_response` attribute indicates whether a response is expected from this
      node when it is executed.
