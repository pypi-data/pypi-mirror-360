class MP285:
    """Sutter MP285 3D Stage API

    The USB interface expects a baud rate of 9600, 8 data bits, 1 stop bits,
    no parity, and no flow control.

    The serial interface expects a baud rate of 9600, 8 data bits, 1 stop bits,
    no parity, and hardware or RTS/CTS flow control.

    Little-endian byte order is used for all commands and responses.

    Each command sequence consists of at least one byte, the first of which is the
    “command byte”. Those commands that have parameters or arguments require a
    sequence of bytes that follow the command byte. No delimiters are used between
    command sequence arguments, and command sequence terminators are used in most cases.

    Most command sequences have a terminator: ASCII CR (Carriage Return; 13 decimal,
    0D hexadecimal) to indicate that the task associated with the command has completed.
    When the controller completes the task associated with a command, it sends ASCII CR
    back to the host computer indicating that it is ready to receive a new command.
    If a command returns data, the last byte returned is the task-completed indicator.
