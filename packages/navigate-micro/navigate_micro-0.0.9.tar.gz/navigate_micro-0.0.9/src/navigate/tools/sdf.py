    Parameters
    ----------
    sdf : function
        A function that accepts (3, NxNxN) points as input and returns the Euclidean
        distance from each point to the object defined by the SDF.
    N : int
        Length of volume axis.
    pixel_size : float
        Rescale the image. Scaling must match object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> volume_from_sdf(lambda p: box(p, (15,15,30,)), 128)
