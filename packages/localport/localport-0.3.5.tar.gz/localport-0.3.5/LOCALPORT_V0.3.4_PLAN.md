# LocalPort v0.3.4 Implementation Plan: Enhanced Service Logging

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Release Goal**: Implement dual-stream logging architecture to enable comprehensive service diagnostics and resolve platform-specific connection stability issues.

**Primary Motivation**: Ubuntu systems show significantly better connection stability than macOS. Current logging sends kubectl/ssh output to `/dev/null`, preventing diagnosis of platform-specific issues.

**Key Deliverable**: Service-specific log files with raw subprocess output, intelligent rotation, and intuitive CLI access.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Dual-Stream Logging Design

#### Current System (Structured Logs)
- **Format**: JSON structured logs via Python logging
- **Purpose**: Application state, daemon lifecycle, health checks
- **Location**: `~/.local/share/localport/logs/daemon.log`
- **Audience**: Developers, automated monitoring

#### New System (Service Logs)
- **Format**: Raw subprocess output with metadata headers
- **Purpose**: kubectl/ssh diagnostics, connection troubleshooting
- **Location**: `~/.local/share/localport/logs/services/<service_id>.log`
- **Audience**: Users troubleshooting connectivity issues

### Directory Structure
```
~/.local/share/localport/logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daemon.log                           # Existing structured logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/                            # New service logs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uhes-postgres-dev_abc123.log     # Service logs with unique ID
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uhes-postgres-dev_abc123.log.1   # Rotated logs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kafka-dev_def456.log
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keycloak_ghi789.log
```

### Service Log Format
```
=== SERVICE START: uhes-postgres-dev ===
Timestamp: 2025-07-04T18:30:00Z
Service ID: uhes-postgres-dev_abc123
Process ID: 12345
Local Port: 6432
Target: remote:5432
Connection Type: kubectl
Namespace: default
Resource: service/postgres
Platform: macOS 14.2.1
LocalPort Version: 0.3.4
=== KUBECTL OUTPUT BEGINS ===
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:6432 -> 5432
Forwarding from [::1]:6432 -> 5432
Handling connection for 6432
...
```
