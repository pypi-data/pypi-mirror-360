# LocalPort v0.3.7 Release Plan: Graceful Daemon Shutdown Architecture

## 🎯 **Release Overview**

**Version**: LocalPort v0.3.7  
**Codename**: "Graceful Exit"  
**Release Type**: Major Feature Release  
**Target Timeline**: 4 weeks (28 days)  
**Primary Objective**: Eliminate 30-second daemon shutdown timeouts through enterprise-grade graceful shutdown architecture

### **📊 Current State Analysis**

**Problems Identified:**
- ❌ Daemon shutdown always times out after 30 seconds
- ❌ Signal handlers create task race conditions in `daemon.py`
- ❌ Background tasks don't handle `asyncio.CancelledError` properly
- ❌ Health monitoring loops (30s intervals) block shutdown
- ❌ Maintenance loop (5-minute cycles) blocks shutdown
- ❌ Cluster health monitoring (4-minute intervals) blocks shutdown
- ❌ No cooperative cancellation patterns
- ❌ Resource cleanup is incomplete

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience (long shutdown waits)
- Potential resource leaks
- Unreliable daemon lifecycle management
- Development/testing friction
- Force-kill required (SIGKILL after 30s timeout)

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Plan**

### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Cooperative Cancellation**: Tasks voluntarily exit when signaled
2. **Phased Shutdown**: Multi-stage shutdown with clear timeouts
3. **Resource Accountability**: Every resource has an owner responsible for cleanup
4. **Signal Coordination**: Proper async/signal integration
5. **Observability**: Clear logging and metrics for shutdown process

### **New Components Architecture**

```
src/localport/infrastructure/shutdown/
├── __init__.py
├── graceful_shutdown_mixin.py      # Base shutdown capabilities
├── task_manager.py                 # Centralized task lifecycle
├── shutdown_coordinator.py         # Multi-phase orchestration
├── signal_handler.py              # Async-aware signal handling
└── cooperative_task.py            # Shutdown-aware task patterns
```

### **Shutdown Flow Design**

```
Signal Received (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
    ↓
AsyncSignalHandler.handle_signal()
    ↓
ShutdownCoordinator.initiate_shutdown()
    ↓
Phase 1: Stop Accepting New Work (2s)
    ↓
Phase 2: Complete Current Operations (8s)
    ↓
Phase 3: Cancel Background Tasks (15s)
    ↓
Phase 4: Force Cleanup Remaining (5s)
    ↓
Exit (Total: ~30s max, target: <5s)
```

## 📋 **ADDENDUM: v0.3.6 UX Completion Items**

**Added: 2025-07-05 13:31 CST**

During v0.3.6 development, the core cluster health monitoring functionality was successfully implemented and is working in production. However, several user experience features were deferred. These items should be included in v0.3.7 alongside the graceful shutdown architecture:

### **v0.3.6 Deferred Items to Include in v0.3.7**

#### **Configuration System (High Priority)**
- [ ] **Extend YAML configuration schema for cluster health**
  ```yaml
  defaults:
    cluster_health:
      enabled: true
      interval: 240  # 4 minutes
      timeout: 30
      retry_attempts: 2
      commands:
        cluster_info: true
        pod_status: true
        node_status: false
        events_on_failure: true
  ```
- [ ] **Configuration validation and migration**
- [ ] **Per-cluster configuration overrides**

#### **CLI Integration (High Priority)**
- [ ] **Extend `localport status` command**
  - Add cluster health section with color-coded indicators
  - Show cluster connectivity and basic stats
  - Display last check timestamp

- [ ] **New `localport cluster` command group**
  - `localport cluster status` - detailed cluster information
  - `localport cluster events` - recent cluster events
  - `localport cluster pods` - pod status for active services

#### **Testing Coverage (Medium Priority)**
- [ ] **Unit tests for cluster health components**
  - `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_cluster_health_monitor.py`
  - `tests/unit/application/test_cluster_health_manager.py`
- [ ] **Integration tests for cluster monitoring workflow**

#### **Documentation (Medium Priority)**
- [ ] **Update `docs/configuration.md` with cluster health settings**
- [ ] **Update `docs/cli-reference.md` with new cluster commands**
- [ ] **Update `docs/troubleshooting.md` with cluster health diagnostics**

### **Updated v0.3.7 Scope**

LocalPort v0.3.7 will now include:

1. **Primary Focus**: Graceful daemon shutdown architecture (4 weeks)
2. **Secondary Focus**: v0.3.6 UX completion (1 week)
3. **Total Timeline**: 5 weeks

This ensures users get both the core stability improvements from v0.3.6 AND the user experience features that were originally planned.
