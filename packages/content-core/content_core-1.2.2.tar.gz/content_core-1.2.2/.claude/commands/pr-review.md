When I ask you to do a PR, you will commit the necessary files and open up a pull request. As soon as you open the pull request, an automatic review process will start. The review process will provide feedback on the code quality and best practices, potential bugs or issues, performance considerations, security concerns, and test coverage.

You should query the PR after opening it to get the commends from the review tool. Then, you will assess the comments and propose me which of them we need to address. 

Then, we'll do the changes, commit them and add a comment back to the PR so that the review tool undertands what we changed and what we ignored.
