# ccexport

Export Claude Code (cc) chat history to markdown format. A minimal CLI tool that extracts conversation history from Claude Code's local storage.

## Features

- Exports the most recent Claude Code session for any project
- Outputs clean markdown with only user/assistant messages
- Filters out tool calls, thinking blocks, and interrupted messages
- Handles special characters in directory names (underscores â†’ dashes)
- No configuration needed - uses Claude's standard storage location (~/.claude)
