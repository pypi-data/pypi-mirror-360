Context-Aware Indexing System for GitHub Issues
----------------------------------------------
This module implements the context-aware indexing system for GitHub issues
as specified in issue #10. It links issues to project milestones and discussion themes,
maintains relational context across discussions, and prevents stagnation.

The system provides functions to load issues, extract discussion themes and resolution patterns,
track delayed resolution, and perform other context-aware indexing operations.
