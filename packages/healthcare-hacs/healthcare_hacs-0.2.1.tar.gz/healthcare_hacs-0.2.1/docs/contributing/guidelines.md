## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Code Style and Standards

HACS follows strict code quality standards:

```bash
# Format code with ruff
uv run ruff format .

# Lint code
uv run ruff check .

# Type checking
uv run pyright

# Run all quality checks
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run pyright
```

#### Code Style Guidelines
- **100% typed code**: All functions and classes must have type hints
- **Pydantic models**: Use Pydantic v2 for all data models
- **Descriptive names**: Use clear, healthcare-appropriate naming
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public APIs
- **Error handling**: Provide meaningful error messages

### 2. Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests for specific package
uv run --package hacs-core pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=hacs_core --cov=hacs_models --cov=hacs_tools

# Run integration tests
uv run python tests/test_integration_e2e.py
```

#### Testing Guidelines
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test cross-package functionality
- **Performance tests**: Ensure <300ms CRUD operations
- **FHIR compliance tests**: Validate round-trip conversions
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

### 3. Documentation Requirements

All contributions should include documentation updates:

```bash
# Update module documentation
docs/modules/hacs-[package].md

# Add examples
docs/examples/

# Update API reference
docs/reference/api.md
```

#### Documentation Standards
- **Clear examples**: Provide working code examples
- **Healthcare context**: Explain clinical relevance
- **API documentation**: Document all public interfaces
- **Migration guides**: For breaking changes
- **Performance notes**: Document performance characteristics
