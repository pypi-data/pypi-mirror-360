# Security Policy

## Overview

The HACS (Healthcare Agent Communication Standard) project takes security seriously, especially given the healthcare context of our software. This document outlines our security policies, how to report vulnerabilities, and what to expect from our security response process.

## Healthcare Data Protection

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Never commit or share real patient data or Protected Health Information (PHI) in any form.**

- **No Real Data**: Use only synthetic, de-identified, or properly anonymized data
- **Test Data**: All examples and tests must use fictional healthcare data
- **Documentation**: Ensure all documentation uses synthetic examples
- **Code Reviews**: All contributions are reviewed for potential PHI exposure

### Compliance Considerations

While HACS is a development framework and not a complete healthcare solution, we design with healthcare compliance in mind:

- **HIPAA Awareness**: Consider HIPAA requirements in design decisions
- **GDPR Compliance**: Respect international privacy regulations
- **FHIR Standards**: Follow FHIR R4 security recommendations
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive audit capabilities

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ‚úÖ Current release |
| < 0.1   | ‚ùå Not supported   |

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Actor-based Access Control**: All operations require authenticated actors
- **Permission System**: Fine-grained permissions for different operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all healthcare data
- **Type Safety**: Full type checking to prevent runtime errors

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all network communications
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls for healthcare data
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process necessary data

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**üö® DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues through one of these secure channels:

#### Primary Contact
- **Email**: security@hacs-project.org
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the issue`

#### Alternative Contact
- **Email**: maintainers@hacs-project.org (if primary contact is unavailable)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your security report:

#### Required Information
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, dependencies

#### Optional Information
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **Timeline**: Any timeline constraints for disclosure

### Example Security Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Potential SQL Injection in Patient Search

Description:
The patient search functionality appears vulnerable to SQL injection attacks
when processing search queries with special characters.

Impact:
- Potential unauthorized access to patient data
- Possible data corruption or deletion
- HIPAA compliance violation risk

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the patient search API endpoint
2. Submit a search query with SQL injection payload: "'; DROP TABLE patients; --"
3. Observe that the query is executed without proper sanitization

Affected Versions:
- HACS 0.1.0 and earlier

Environment:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL 14

Suggested Fix:
Implement parameterized queries and input sanitization for all database operations.
```

## Security Response Process

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution Target**: 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact
3. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop a fix
4. **Testing**: We test the fix thoroughly
5. **Release**: We release a security update
6. **Disclosure**: We coordinate public disclosure

### Severity Classification

We classify security issues using the following severity levels:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Immediate threat to patient safety
- Unauthorized access to PHI
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Significant data exposure risk
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- Major compliance violations

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited data exposure
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- Minor compliance issues

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minimal security impact
- Configuration issues
- Documentation problems
- Low-risk information disclosure

## Coordinated Disclosure

### Our Commitment

- **Responsible Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices
- **Credit**: We provide credit to security researchers (unless they prefer anonymity)
- **Communication**: We keep reporters informed throughout the process
- **Timeline**: We work with reporters to establish reasonable disclosure timelines

### Public Disclosure

After a security issue is resolved:

1. **Security Advisory**: We publish a security advisory
2. **CVE Assignment**: We request CVE assignment for significant issues
3. **Release Notes**: We include security fixes in release notes
4. **Documentation**: We update security documentation as needed

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of HACS
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activities

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Backup Security**: Secure all backups appropriately
- **Access Logging**: Enable comprehensive access logging
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs strictly
- **Output Encoding**: Encode all outputs appropriately
- **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication

- **Testing**: Include security testing in your test suite

## Security Tools and Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

We use several tools to maintain security:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
uv audit

# Static security analysis
bandit -r packages/

# Code quality and security linting
ruff check --select S  # Security-related rules

# Type checking (helps prevent runtime errors)
pyright
```

### Security Testing

```bash
# Run security-focused tests
pytest tests/ -k security

# Check for common security issues
bandit -r packages/ -f json -o security-report.json

# Dependency vulnerability check
safety check --json --output security-deps.json
```
