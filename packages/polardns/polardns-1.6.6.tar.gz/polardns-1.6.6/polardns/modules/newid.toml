This modifier generates a new Transaction ID (TXID) for the DNS response, causing a mismatch with the Transaction ID that was sent in the query.

The Transaction ID is a 2-byte field located at the beginning of the DNS packet. In standard DNS communication, the Transaction ID in the response must precisely match the Transaction ID in the query. If they do not match, it indicates that the response is unrelated to the original query.

This modifier is compatible with and can be combined with any other existing feature or modifier.
