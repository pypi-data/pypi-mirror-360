This modifier directs PolarDNS to respond with only the DNS header with the Truncated (TC) bit flag set. This flag signals to the resolver/client that the response is too large, prompting it to retry the query over TCP.

In essence, this modifier allows us to enforce the use of TCP mode for communication between the resolver/client and PolarDNS.

This modifier is compatible with and can be combined with any other existing feature or modifier.

description = "In this example, we use the [basic] always feature which always resolves to an IP address. We request the Truncated (TC) bit to be set in the DNS response. As a result, the client retries the query using TCP mode:"

description = "In this example, we use the [size] feature which returns multiple anwers at once. Once again we request the Truncated (TC) bit to be set in the DNS response. As a result, the client retries the query using TCP mode:"
