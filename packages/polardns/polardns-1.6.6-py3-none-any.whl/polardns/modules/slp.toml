This modifier adds an arbitrary delay to DNS responses, allowing users to set a specified delay (sleep) in milliseconds before the response is sent.

This can be useful for testing DNS resolvers by causing them to wait for a specified period before receiving a response from the PolarDNS server.

Such approach can occupy a resolution worker/thread on the target DNS resolver for a specified period of time. Sending numerous such requests simultaneously can potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) situation on the resolver.

This modifier is compatible with and can be combined with any other existing feature or modifier.

:warning:**BEWARE**:warning:This can potentially lead to domain lock-up (DoS).

Where:

- The **`<MILLISECONDS>`** parameter specifies the duration (in milliseconds) to sleep before the response is sent. Note that 1,000 milliseconds equals to 1 second.
