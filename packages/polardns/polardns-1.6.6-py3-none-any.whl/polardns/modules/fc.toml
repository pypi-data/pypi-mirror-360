command = "dig always.fc.yourdomain.com @127.0.0.1"

description = "Similar to the previous example, but in this case we request to disable DNS compression using the [nc] modifier:"
command = "dig always.nc.yourdomain.com @127.0.0.1"

description = "In this example, we use the [size] feature to fit as many A records as possible within a 300-byte size limit. Additionally, we request to enable DNS compression for the response:"
