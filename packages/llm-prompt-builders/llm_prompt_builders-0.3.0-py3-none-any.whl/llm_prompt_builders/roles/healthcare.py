"""Healthcare role system prompts.
This module provides system‑prompt builder functions for every healthcare role extracted
from supplied reference text. Each function returns a concise multi‑sentence string
that tells the LLM *what the role is* (mandate, focus, priorities, cognitive style)
and *what it is not* (key constraints / exclusions), mirroring the style used in
`llm_prompt_builders.roles.lifescience`.
