# KomPlot

KomPlot provides a convenience layer around selected [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) plotting functions, making it possible to construct a useful plot in a single function call, which is particularly useful for use within an interactive [ipython](https://ipython.org) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) session. KomPlot also provides a number of interactive controls, including zooming by mouse wheel scroll, colormap shifts when viewing images, and shifting between displayed slices of a volume.


## Installation

The [online documentation](https://komplot.rtfd.io) includes [installation instructions](https://komplot.rtfd.io/en/latest/install.html).


## Usage Examples

Usage examples are available in directory `examples`.


## License

KomPlot is distributed as open-source software under a BSD 3-Clause License (see the `LICENSE` file for details).
