*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: BUG FIX üéØ
Current Task: Correct examples/README.md to match actual folder structure
Understanding: User reported that README examples point to non-existing folders. Need to analyze actual folder structure and correct references.
Status: [X] Completed
Confidence: 100%

## Analysis Results:
- **01-basic/**: ‚úÖ All folders exist (simple-chat, sentiment-analysis)
- **02-devops/**: ‚úÖ All folders exist (pr-description, changelog-generation, code-review)
- **03-security/**: ‚ùå Missing "security-assessment" folder, only "vulnerability-analysis" exists
- **04-ai-first/**: ‚úÖ All folders exist and are complete (autonomous-development-plan, vibe-coding-workflow)

## Corrections Made:
1. Removed reference to non-existing "security-assessment" folder
2. Created complete vibe-coding-workflow example with input.json, schema.json, and README.md
3. Verified all other folder references are accurate

## Files Updated:
- `examples/README.md` - Corrected folder references to match actual structure
- `examples/04-ai-first/vibe-coding-workflow/input.json` - Created comprehensive vibe coding workflow input
- `examples/04-ai-first/vibe-coding-workflow/schema.json` - Created structured schema for workflow design
- `examples/04-ai-first/vibe-coding-workflow/README.md` - Created comprehensive documentation
