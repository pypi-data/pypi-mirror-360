# What is Therix.ai?

Therix simplifies the adoption of GenAI for enterprises, enabling them to build, deploy, and monitor scalable GenAI applications and agents. Ensure your operations are secure, private, and compliant with our private SDKs.

# How does it work?

Therix is generally available as a SaaS offering on [app.therix.ai](http://app.therix.ai). You can create your custom AI workflows ( called agents within therix ), and use our SDK to integrate with your apps.
