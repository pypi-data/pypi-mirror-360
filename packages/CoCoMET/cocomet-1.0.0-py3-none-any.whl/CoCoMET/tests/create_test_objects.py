# TODO: Create a basic case study of one isolated cell and one MCS to input in the tracks
# Should also convert this one case into the various model types / CoCoMET input types to test.
# This can be used later for unit testing of individual functions

    """

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_shape : length 4 tuple
        The shape of the domain you want to create in number of grid points (t,x,y,z). i.e. (20,500,500,50).
    cell_var : string, ["dbz", "tb"]
        The variable you want to use to define the cell, either reflectivity or brightness temperature.
    cell_radius : int
        The radius of the cell in # of grid points.
    max_dbz : float, optional
        The maximum desired reflectivity value if using dbz as cell_var. The default is None.
    min_tb : float, optional
        The minimum desired brightness temperature value if using tb as cell_var. The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    cell_grid : numpy.ndarray
        A numpy array of shape equivelant to grid_shape but has either reflectivity or brightness temperature values.
