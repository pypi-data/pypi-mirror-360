Bayesian Inference (BI) software is available in both Python and R. It aims to unify the modeling experience by integrating an intuitive model-building syntax with the flexibility of low-level abstraction coding available but also pre-build function for high-level of abstraction and including hardware-accelerated computation for improved scalability.
