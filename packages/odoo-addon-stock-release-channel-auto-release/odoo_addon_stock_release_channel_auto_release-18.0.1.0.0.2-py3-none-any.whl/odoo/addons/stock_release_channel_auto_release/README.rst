This addons define an automatic release mode on the release channels. By
default release channels manage the release of the transfers in batch
mode. This means that the transfers are released only when the user
manually triggers the release process by clicking on the release button.

When the automatic release mode is enabled, the transfers are released
automatically when a new transfer is added to the channel or as soon a
product becomes available.

As for the batch mode, the automatic release process is only active on
open channels. When is locked, the automatic release process is stopped.
Once the channel is unlocked, the automatic release process is restarted
and transfers into the channel are released if they are ready to be
released (IOW if quantities are available for moves not yet released).
