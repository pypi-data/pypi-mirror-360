```python
from gui_decorator import gui

@gui(title="The Title",
     width=600,
     height=400,
     input_filter=[("Excel files", ".xlsx")],
     output_filter=[("Excel files", ".xlsx"))])
def foo(input_path, output_path):
  # use `yield` to send logs to the GUI
  yield f"Got input_path: {input_path}"
  yield f"Got output_path: {output_path}"

foo()
```

Decorator `gui` treats function `foo` as a generator and fetches logs from `foo` to its logging box. The wrapped function must include at least one `yield` to be treated as a generator.
