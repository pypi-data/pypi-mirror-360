Features
~~~~~~~~

* Versatile View widget with many optional mixin classes to cater for

  large PDF documents remains fast and smooth.
* Almost infinite zooming thanks to tile-based rendering and caching.
* Magnifier glass.
* Printing functionality, directly to cups or via Qt/QPrinter.
* Can display pages originating from different documents at the same time.
* Can show the difference between pages that are almost the same via
  color composition.
