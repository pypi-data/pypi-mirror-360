### Basic Example

Here's how simple it is to use synth.codeai with the recommended Gemini configuration:

```bash
# Install synth.codeai
pip install synth-codeai

# Set up API keys (Gemini recommended, Tavily optional for web search)
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key'
export TAVILY_API_KEY='your_tavily_api_key'

# Start using it
synth-codeai -m "Add input validation to the login form"
```

synth.codeai will automatically use Gemini 2.5 Pro if only the `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set. You can optionally add `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` if you prefer to use those models. See the [Recommended Config](/quickstart/recommended) for more details.
