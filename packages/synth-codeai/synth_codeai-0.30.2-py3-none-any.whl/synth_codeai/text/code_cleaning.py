def fix_triple_quote_contents(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Fixes potentially incorrect escaping of nested triple quotes within Python code.

    Assumes that outermost triple quotes start on the first line and end on the last line
    of a string literal. Escapes any unescaped inner triple quotes of matching style.

    Args:
        text: A string containing Python code, potentially with unescaped
              nested triple quotes.

    Returns:
        A string with the nested triple quotes properly escaped.
