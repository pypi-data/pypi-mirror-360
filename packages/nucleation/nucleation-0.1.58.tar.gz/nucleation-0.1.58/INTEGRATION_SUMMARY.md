- âœ… **Palette Generation** - Extract usable color palettes from builds
- âœ… **Color Distribution Mapping** - Track usage of specific colors

### 3. **Block Transform Operations**
- âœ… **Material Replacement** - Convert between materials while preserving shapes (oak_stairs â†’ stone_stairs)
- âœ… **Shape Conversion** - Transform between shapes while preserving materials (stone â†’ stone_stairs)
- âœ… **Color-Based Matching** - Find and replace blocks based on color similarity
- âœ… **Custom Transform Functions** - Apply arbitrary transformations with predicates
- âœ… **Property Preservation** - Maintain directional and state properties during transforms

### 4. **API Integration**

- âœ… **Region-Level Operations** - Transform specific regions independently
- âœ… **Batch Operations** - Apply multiple transformations efficiently
- âœ… **Type-Safe Conversions** - Convert between Nucleation and Blockpedia block formats

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- âœ… **Comprehensive Tests** - Created `tests/blockpedia_integration_test.rs` with 6 test cases
- âœ… **Working Example** - Built `examples/blockpedia_showcase.rs` demonstrating features
- âœ… **Documentation** - Created detailed integration guide and usage examples
- âœ… **Feature Detection** - Graceful handling when blockpedia features are disabled

## ðŸš€ Key Features in Action

### Color Analysis
```rust
let analysis = schematic.analyze_colors()?;
// Returns: coverage %, harmony score, dominant colors, distribution
```

### Material Swapping
```rust
let replacements = schematic.replace_material("oak", "stone")?;
// Converts oak_stairs â†’ stone_stairs, oak_planks â†’ stone, etc.
```

### Shape Transformation
```rust
let conversions = schematic.convert_to_shape("stone", BlockShape::Stairs)?;
// Converts stone â†’ stone_stairs with proper default properties
```

### Color Matching
```rust
let target = ExtendedColorData::from_rgb(125, 125, 125); // Gray
let matches = schematic.replace_with_color_match(target, 25.0)?;
// Finds blocks within 25.0 color distance and replaces them
```

### Custom Transformations
```rust
schematic.replace_blocks_matching(
    |block| block.name.contains("planks"),
    |block| block.with_material("brick")
)?;
```
