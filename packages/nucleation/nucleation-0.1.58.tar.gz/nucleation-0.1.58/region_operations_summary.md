# Region Operations Module Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a new `region_operations.rs` module that provides advanced transformation and analysis capabilities for regions within Nucleation schematics. This module integrates with the blockpedia library to offer intelligent block manipulation, color analysis, and batch operations.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Advanced Color Analysis
- **RegionColorAnalysis**: Comprehensive color analysis of blocks within a region
- Extracts dominant colors from block textures
- Calculates color harmony scores
- Provides color distribution statistics
- Determines coverage percentage of colored vs uncolored blocks

### 2. Material and Shape Transformations
- **Material Replacement**: Convert all blocks of one material to another while preserving shapes (e.g., oak_stairs → stone_stairs)
- **Shape Conversion**: Transform blocks to specific shapes while maintaining materials (e.g., stone → stone_stairs)
- **Color-based Replacement**: Replace blocks matching specific colors within tolerance ranges

### 3. Block Rotation System
- Support for 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations
- Proper handling of directional block properties
- Integration with blockpedia's rotation capabilities

### 4. Batch Operations
- **BatchOperation** enum for efficient bulk transformations
- Support for chaining multiple operations
- Atomic operations with rollback capability

### 5. Advanced Search and Filtering
- **find_blocks()**: Search blocks matching custom criteria
- Position tracking for matched blocks
- Flexible predicate-based filtering

### 6. Color Palette Extraction
- Generate color palettes from region blocks
- Integration with blockpedia's palette generation algorithms
- Support for various palette sizes

## Architecture

### Error Handling
- **RegionError**: Comprehensive error type covering transformation, color, and validation errors
- Proper error conversion between Nucleation and blockpedia types
- Graceful fallback behavior for unsupported operations

### Type Conversions
- Seamless conversion between Nucleation BlockState and blockpedia BlockState
- Property preservation during transformations
- String parsing for complex block states

### Integration Points
- **UniversalSchematic**: High-level operations across all regions
- **Region**: Direct region-specific transformations
- **BlockState**: Enhanced with blockpedia integration methods

## Usage Examples

```rust
use nucleation::{UniversalSchematic, Region};
use nucleation::region_operations::{BatchOperation, RegionColorAnalysis};
use blockpedia::transforms::BlockShape;

// Color analysis
let analysis = region.analyze_colors()?;
println!("Color coverage: {:.1}%", analysis.coverage_percentage);

// Material replacement
let replacements = region.replace_material("oak", "stone")?;
println!("Replaced {} blocks", replacements);

// Batch operations
let operations = vec![
    BatchOperation::ReplaceMaterial { 
        from: "oak".to_string(), 
        to: "stone".to_string() 
    },
    BatchOperation::ChangeShape { 
        material: "stone".to_string(), 
        target_shape: BlockShape::Stairs 
    },
];
let results = region.apply_batch_operations(&operations)?;

// Color palette extraction
let palette = region.extract_color_palette(8)?;
```

## Testing

- Added comprehensive unit tests for all major features
- Integration tests with blockpedia functionality
- Error handling and edge case validation
- Compilation verification across different feature sets

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Blockpedia is now a core dependency rather than an optional feature
- All blockpedia integration is always available
- Removed conditional compilation complexity

### Performance
- Efficient palette-based transformations
- Minimal memory allocation during operations
- Cached color calculations for repeated operations

### Extensibility
- Modular design allows for easy addition of new transformation types
- Plugin architecture for custom transformation functions
- Clear separation between core and advanced operations

## Future Enhancements

The module is designed to be easily extensible with:
- Custom transformation plugins
- Additional color spaces and analysis methods
- More sophisticated block matching algorithms
- Integration with external texture analysis tools
- Performance optimizations for large-scale operations

This implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced schematic manipulation while maintaining the library's focus on performance and usability.
