"""
Triple-use minimum working example for PyXMake. This script can be
executed in three different ways in varying levels of accessibility
 
@note: Compile a static Fortran library using Intel Fortran. 
Created on 20.03.2018    

@version:  1.0    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@requires:
       - PyXMake

@change: 
       - Added 3rd party dependencies to build process. Requires 
         PyCODAC in PYTHONPATH.
