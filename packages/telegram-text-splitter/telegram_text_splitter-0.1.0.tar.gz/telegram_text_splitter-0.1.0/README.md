# Telegram Text Splitter

A Python library for splitting long Markdown texts into smaller, Telegram-friendly chunks. It intelligently breaks down text based on Markdown formatting (paragraphs, lines, words) to ensure that each chunk is a valid and readable piece of text, suitable for sending via Telegram bots.

## Features

*   Splits Markdown text into chunks, each respecting Telegram's message length limits.
*   Prioritizes splitting at natural boundaries like paragraph breaks (`\n\n`), line breaks (`\n`), and spaces.
*   Ensures that no Markdown formatting is broken, making subsequent conversion to HTML (e.g., using `chatgpt-md-converter`) reliable.
*   Lightweight and dependency-free (except for standard Python libraries).

## Installation

You can install the library directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kobaltgit/telegram_text_splitter.git
```

Alternatively, if you have the library cloned locally, you can install it in editable mode:

```bash
cd path/to/your/telegram_text_splitter_lib
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `split_markdown_into_chunks` function:

```python
from telegram_text_splitter import split_markdown_into_chunks

long_markdown_text = """
# My Awesome Title

This is the first paragraph. It contains some text that needs to be split.
We are aiming for chunks that are less than 4000 characters.

This is the second paragraph. It's separated by a double newline.

### A Subheading

*   Item 1
*   Item 2
    *   Sub-item 2.1
    *   Sub-item 2.2

And a very long word that might cause issues if not handled correctly: Antidisestablishmentarianism.
"""

chunks = split_markdown_into_chunks(long_markdown_text)

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"--- Chunk {i+1} (Length: {len(chunk)}) ---")
    print(chunk)
    print("-" * 20)

# Example usage in a Telegram bot handler:
# from aiogram import Bot, types
# from aiogram.enums import ParseMode
# from telegram_text_splitter import split_markdown_into_chunks
# from chatgpt_md_converter import telegram_format # Assuming this is imported elsewhere
# from utils.message_sender import send_long_message

# async def send_ai_response(bot: Bot, chat_id: int, ai_markdown_response: str, i18n):
#     markdown_chunks = split_markdown_into_chunks(ai_markdown_response)
#     for md_chunk in markdown_chunks:
#         html_chunk = telegram_format(md_chunk)
#         await send_long_message(
#             bot=bot,
#             chat_id=chat_id,
#             text_chunks=[html_chunk], # Send each HTML chunk as a single item list
#             keyboard=None, # Add your keyboard here if needed
#             parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML
#         )

```
