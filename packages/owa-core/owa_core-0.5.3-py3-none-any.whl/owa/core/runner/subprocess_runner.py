"""
Subprocess management utility for running external processes as threads.

This module provides tools to run and manage external processes in a thread-safe manner,
with proper handling of termination signals and cleanup. The implementation is
optimized for Windows environments with special handling for process group signals.

    DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION.
    Instead, pass CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP to the subprocess.Popen() function
    and send CTRL_BREAK_EVENT signal instead of CTRL_C_EVENT. CTRL_C_EVENT does NOT work.

    ===
    Disable Ctrl+C once. This function must be called before sending Ctrl+C to a process.
    Utilizing this function is not preferred, as this function must be called in main thread, which is not guaranteed in common.

class SubprocessRunner(RunnableThread):
    """
    Thread-based runner for managing subprocesses with proper termination handling.

    This class extends RunnableThread to run external processes in a controlled manner,
    allowing clean shutdown and resource cleanup when the parent application terminates.
    It's particularly designed to handle Windows-specific process group behavior.

    Example usage:
    ```python

        cmd = ["gst-launch-1.0.exe", "-e", "-v", "videotestsrc", "!", "videoconvert", "!", "autovideosink"]

            # Configure and start the subprocess
