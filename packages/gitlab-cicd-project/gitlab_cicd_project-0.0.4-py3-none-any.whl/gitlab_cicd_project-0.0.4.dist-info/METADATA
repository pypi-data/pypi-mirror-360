## 🔧 Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install gitlab-cicd-project
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

After installation, start a Jupyter notebook and run:

```python
from gitlab_cicd_project import hello

# Launch the WiFi Speed Test Dashboard
hello()
```

You can also use the package from the command line:

```bash
gitlab-cicd-project
```

Alternatively, you can use it in your Python code:

```python
from gitlab_cicd_project import hello

# Print welcome message
hello()
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### WiFi Speed Test Dashboard

```python
from gitlab_cicd_project import WifiSpeedTester

# Create a speed tester instance
tester = WifiSpeedTester()

# Display the dashboard
tester.display()
```

![WiFi Speed Test Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shreyasprabhakar/gitlab-cicd-project/images/dashboard_sample.png)

The dashboard provides:

- Real-time download and upload speed monitoring
- Ping latency tracking
- Current WiFi network information
- Interactive charts and gauges
- Snapshot functionality to save test results as JSON

## 📦 Dependencies

This package relies on the following key libraries:

- **ipywidgets** (8.0.6+): Interactive widgets for Jupyter
- **plotly** (5.24.1+): Interactive visualization library
- **speedtest-cli** (2.1.3+): Speed test measurement
- **pandas** (2.1.3+): Data manipulation
- **psutil** (6.0.0+): System monitoring and network information
- **jupyter** (1.0.0+): Jupyter notebook environment
- **ipython** (8.12.0+): Interactive Python shell

## 🖥️ Environment Support

**⚠️ Important: Currently Only Supports Jupyter Notebook Environment**

This package is designed to work exclusively within Jupyter Notebook environments. The interactive dashboard features rely on Jupyter's widget system and will not function in:

- Standard Python scripts
- Command-line interfaces
- Regular web browsers without Jupyter

To use this package, you must run it from within a Jupyter notebook.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-shrprabh/gitlab-cicd-project.git
   cd gitlab-cicd-project
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## 📦 Building the Package

1. Install build tools:

   ```bash
   pip install setuptools wheel twine
   ```

2. Build distribution packages:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

   This will create distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

## 🚢 Publishing to PyPI

### Manual Publishing

1. Set up your PyPI credentials:

   ```bash
   export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
   export TWINE_PASSWORD=your-pypi-token
   ```

2. Upload the package to PyPI:
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

### GitLab CI/CD Integration

This project includes GitLab CI/CD configuration for automated testing and publishing:

1. Set the following environment variables in your GitLab CI/CD settings:

   - `TWINE_USERNAME`: Set to `__token__`
   - `TWINE_PASSWORD`: Your PyPI API token

2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
   - Run tests
   - Build distribution packages
   - Publish to PyPI (on tagged releases)

#### CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. **Build Stage**: Creates distribution packages
2. **Test Stage**: Runs automated tests
3. **Publish Stage**: Uploads the package to PyPI (only on tagged commits)

To create a new release:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```
