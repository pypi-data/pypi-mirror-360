# BI Documentation Tool - Executive Overview

## What is the BI Documentation Tool?

The BI Documentation Tool automatically creates comprehensive documentation for your organization's Business Intelligence files (Power BI reports and Tableau workbooks). Instead of manually documenting what's in each report, this tool extracts all the important information automatically.

## Why Your Organization Needs This

#### Knowledge is Trapped in BI Files

- Important business logic is hidden inside report files
- Data sources and calculations aren't visible to stakeholders
- Impact analysis is difficult when data sources change
- Audit trails are incomplete or missing

### The Solution We Provide

#### Automatic Documentation Generation

- Extract all metadata from BI files in seconds
