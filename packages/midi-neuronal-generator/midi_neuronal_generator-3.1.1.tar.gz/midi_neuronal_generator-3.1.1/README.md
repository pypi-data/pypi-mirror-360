# Midi-Neuronal-Generator
This program aims to generate listenable midi sequences.

Sincerely thanks for keras, the neuronal network model we have applied.
In this program, we have combined a LSTM layer, a Dense layer with the activation Sigmoid and an Activation of Softmax layer before v3.0.
And after v3.1, the construction has been changed into two GRU layer and a Dense layer with the activation Softmax, due to GRU has a faster processing speed than LSTM.
