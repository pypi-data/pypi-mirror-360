This is a python library to build a single prompt and output the JSON format for any LLMS. 
It is useful when you have enselmble of LLMS and you want to use the same prompt for all of them,
or if you are testing a new prompt and you want to see which LLMS respond best to it. 

The library is designed to be extensible and allow for easy addition of new LLMS and new message types. 

The library is also designed to be async friendly.
