# EPyT-Control -- EPANET Python Toolkit - Control

<img src="https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Control/blob/main/docs/_static/gimmick.png?raw=true" align="center" height="230px"/>

EPyT-Control is a Python package building on top of [EPyT-Flow](https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Flow) 
for implementing and evaluating control algorithms & strategies in water distribution networks (WDNs).

Besides related control tasks such as state estimation and event diagnosis, a special focus of this
Python package is Reinforcement Learning for data-driven control in WDNs and therefore it provides
full compatibility with the
[Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) package.


## Unique Features

Unique features of EPyT-Control are the following:

- Support of hydraulic and (advanced) water quality simulation (i.e. EPANET and EPANET-MSX are supported)
- Compatibility with [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) and integration of [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- Wide variety of pre-defined actions (e.g. pump state actions, pump speed actons, valve state actions, species injection actions, etc.)
- Implementation of classic control aglorithms such as PID and LQR controllers
- Signal processing methods such as state estimation (e.g. Kalman filters) and event diagnosis
- Neural surrogate models for state transition
- High- and low-level interface
- Object-orientated design that is easy to extend and customize

## Quick Example

#### Interface of Environments

Basic example demonstrating the environments' interface:

```python
# Define/Specify MyEnv
# ....

# Load hypothetical environment "MyEnv"
with MyEnv() as env:
    # Show the observation space
    print(f"Observation space: {env.observation_space}")

    # Run 1000 iterations -- assuming that autorest=True
    obs, info = env.reset()
    for _ in range(1000):
        # Sample and apply a random action from the action space.
        # TODO: Replace with some smart RL/control method
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        obs, reward, terminated, _, _ = env.step(action)

        # Show action and observed reward
        print(action, reward)
```

#### Applying Reinforcement Learning to a given Environment

Simple example of using [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for learning a policy to control the chlorine injection in a given environment called ```SimpleChlorineInjectionEnv```:

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from gymnasium.wrappers import NormalizeObservation

# Define/Specify SimpleChlorineInjectionEnv
# ....

# Load chlorine injection environment
with SimpleChlorineInjectionEnv() as env:
    # Wrap environment
    env = NormalizeObservation(env)

    # Apply a simple policy learner
    # You might want to add more wrappers (e.g. normalizing inputs, rewards, etc.) and logging here
    # Also, inceasing the number of time steps might help as well
    model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
    model.learn(total_timesteps=1000)
    model.save("my_model_clinject.zip")  # Save policy
```
