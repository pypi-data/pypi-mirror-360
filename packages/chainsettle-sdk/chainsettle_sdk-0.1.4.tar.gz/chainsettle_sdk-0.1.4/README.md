# Initialize the service
chainsettle = ChainSettleService()

# Initiate a settlement attestation
response = chainsettle.initiate_attestation(
    settlement_id="unique_settlement_id",
    settlement_type="plaid",
    network="base",
    user_email="user@example.com",
    amount=10000,
    recipient_email="recipient@example.com",
    counterparty="0xCounterpartyAddress",
    metadata="Optional metadata"
