# NoTorch üïØ

**A pure Python, educational machine learning library ‚Äî built from scratch.**

**NoTorch** is a learning-focused machine learning and deep learning library that re-implements popular models using only core Python (and `pandas` for data handling). Inspired by the design of `scikit-learn` and `PyTorch`, NoTorch offers a simple and consistent API while prioritizing **readability**, **clarity**, and **educational value** over performance or production use.

This project is being developed as part of a personal journey to deeply understand how machine learning works ‚Äî and to help others learn by example. Whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or just curious about what happens *under the hood* of your favorite ML libraries, NoTorch is here to make complex concepts transparent and approachable.

## üîç Project Goals

* ‚úÖ Build core ML and DL models **from scratch** in pure Python
* ‚úÖ Keep the code **readable**, **modular**, and **well-documented**
* ‚úÖ Mimic the familiar APIs of `sklearn` and `torch` for a smoother learning curve
* ‚úÖ Prioritize **educational clarity** over performance or abstraction
* ‚úÖ Share the learning journey with the community

model = KNN(n_neighbors=1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(model.predict(X_test))
```
