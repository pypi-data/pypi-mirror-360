# The nexus-rpc name in PyPi was originally held by an unrelated project that reached
# 1.0.1 and was abandoned in 2018. The name was inherited by the Python Nexus SDK in
# 2025 and version numbering started from 1.1.0. Despite the version number, this is an
# experimental release and backwards-incompatible changes are anticipated until a GA
# release is announced.
