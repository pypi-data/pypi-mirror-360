# Fishjam Python Server SDK

Python server SDK for the [Fishjam](https://fishjam.io/).

Read the docs [here](https://fishjam-cloud.github.io/python-server-sdk)

## Installation

```
pip install fishjam-server-sdk
```

## Usage

The SDK exports two main classes for interacting with Fishjam server:
`FishjamClient` and `FishjamNotifier`.

`FishjamClient` wraps http REST api calls, while `FishjamNotifier` is responsible for receiving real-time updates from the server.

#### FishjamClient

Create a `FishjamClient` instance, providing the fishjam server address and api token

```python
from fishjam import FishjamClient

fishjam_client = FishjamClient(fishjam_url="localhost:5002", management_token="development")
```

You can use it to interact with Fishjam to manage rooms and peers

```python
# Create a room
options = RoomOptions(video_codec="h264", webhook_url="http://localhost:5000/webhook")
room = fishjam_client.create_room(options=options)

# Room(components=[], config=RoomConfig(max_peers=None, video_codec=<RoomConfigVideoCodec.H264: 'h264'>, webhook_url='http://localhost:5000/webhook'), id='1d905478-ccfc-44d6-a6e7-8ccb1b38d955', peers=[])

# Add peer to the room
peer, token = fishjam_client.create_peer(room.id)

# Peer(id='b1232c7e-c969-4450-acdf-ea24f3cdd7f6', status=<PeerStatus.DISCONNECTED: 'disconnected'>, type='webrtc'), 'M8TUGhj-L11KpyG-2zBPIo'
```

All methods in `FishjamClient` may raise one of the exceptions deriving from `fishjam.errors.HTTPError`. They are defined in `fishjam.errors`.

#### FishjamNotifier

FishjamNotifier allows for receiving real-time updates from the Fishjam Server.

You can read more about notifications in the
[Fishjam Docs](https://fishjam-cloud.github.io/fishjam-docs/next/getting_started/notifications).

Create `FishjamNotifier` instance

```python
from fishjam import FishjamNotifier

fishjam_notifier = FishjamNotifier(fishjam_url='localhost:5002', management_token='development')
```

Then define a handler for incoming messages

```python
@notifier.on_server_notification
def handle_notification(server_notification):
    print(f'Received a notification: {server_notification}')
```

After that you can start the notifier

```python
async def test_notifier():
    notifier_task = asyncio.create_task(fishjam_notifier.connect())

    # Wait for notifier to be ready to receive messages
    await fishjam_notifier.wait_ready()

    # Create a room to trigger a server notification
    fishjam_client = FishjamClient()
    fishjam_client.create_room()

    await notifier_task

asyncio.run(test_notifier())

# Received a notification: ServerMessageRoomCreated(room_id='69a3fd1a-6a4d-47bc-ae54-0c72b0d05e29')
```

## Local development

The project is managed using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Make sure to have it installed first.

Then install the dependencies

```console
poetry install
```

## Generating protobuf

To generate Python protobuf definitions run

```console
poetry run ./compile_proto.sh
```

## Testing

You can test the SDK by running

```console
poetry run ci_test
```

In local development you can use

```console
poetry run local_test
```

## Format & Lint

You can format code by running

```console
poetry run format
```

You can check linter by running

```console
poetry run lint
```

## Documentation

Documentation is generated via openapi-python-client.

To update documentation you need to:

- in `poetry_scripts.py` change branch from which openapi.yaml should be downloaded
- run `poetry run update-client`
