1. Using a bespoke `RandomNixTree` class gives you direct, imperative control over exactly how each node is generated, without needing to learn Hypothesis’s strategy API.
2. You can immediately see and tweak the error-injection logic in each generator method, rather than backtracking through nested `map` and `flatmap` calls.
3. The stateful `self.valid` flag means you only need a simple boolean check at the end, instead of carrying validity through a complex tuple or dict wrapper in every strategy.
4. You avoid the startup cost of Hypothesis rebuilding and validating huge strategy graphs on each example draw.
5. There’s no “magic” shrinking or caching overhead—just a straightforward random walk through your own code.
6. Debugging is easier, since you can step through each `_gen_*` method in your debugger rather than the opaque internals of a property-based engine.
7. You have fewer dependencies (no Hypothesis), which simplifies CI setups and virtual environment management.
8. The algorithm is entirely transparent: every branch of the dispatch table is visible and can be instrumented with prints or logging.
9. Reproducibility is under your control—you seed the `random.Random` once and get the same sequence of trees whenever you like.
10. Overall, the custom generator trades Hypothesis’s flexibility for clarity, speed, and minimal infrastructure, making it a lightweight solution when you just need random test cases.
