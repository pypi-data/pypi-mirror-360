- Added type annotations (parameter and return types) to function signatures in Python and Go LSP mode
- Added Python Enum extraction in LSP mode
- Added improved Go receiver methods extraction with support for pointers and generics
- Added comprehensive E2E tests for LSP functionality
- Updated CLI, documentation, and example client to support the new mode

### Changed

- Improved error handling on create_workplan

## [0.3.1] - 2025-04-26

### Changed

- Clarified usage in Cursor/VSCode in `README.md` and try and fix a bug when judging workplans from a different directory.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-04-19

### Added

- Added support for OpenAI `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o4-mini`, and `o3` models.
- Added OpenAI SDK dependency with async client support.
- Added pricing configuration for OpenAI models.
- Added conditional API key validation based on the selected model.
- Updated metrics collection to handle both Gemini and OpenAI usage metadata.
- Added comprehensive test suite raising coverage to ≥70%.
- Integrated coverage gate in CI.

### Changed

- Modified `app_lifespan` to conditionally initialize either Gemini or OpenAI clients based on the selected model.
- Updated client references in `process_workplan_async` and `process_judgement_async` functions.
- Updated documentation and help text to reflect the new model options.

## [0.2.7] - 2025-04-19

### Added

- Added completion metrics to workplans and judgements, including token usage counts and estimated cost.
- Added pricing configuration for Gemini models with tiered pricing based on token thresholds.

## [0.2.6] - 2025-04-18

### Changed

- Default Gemini model updated to `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`.
